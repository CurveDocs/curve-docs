!!!vyper "`FeeSplitter.vy`"
    The source code for the `FeeSplitter.vy` contract can be found on [:material-github: GitHub](https://github.com/curvefi/fee-splitter/blob/main/contracts/FeeSplitter.vy). The contract is written using [Vyper](https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper) version `0.4.0` and utilizes a [snekmate module](https://github.com/pcaversaccio/snekmate/blob/main/src/snekmate/auth/ownable.vy) to handle contract ownership.

    The source code was audited by [:logos-chainsecurity: ChainSecurity](https://www.chainsecurity.com/). The full audit report can be found [here](https://github.com/curvefi/fee-splitter/blob/main/audits/ChainSecurity.pdf).


!!!guard "Guarded Method"
    This function is only callable by the `admin` of the contract.

!!!colab "Google Colab Notebook"
    Unfortunately, there is **no external method to directly check the claimable rewards for an address**. The claimable rewards can **either be checked in the [Curve UI](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/dashboard) or by simulating a claim transaction** and comparing the reward token balances before and after the claim. A Google Colab notebook that simulates such a transaction can be found here: [:simple-googlecolab: Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/198uCIg10fT56q5nhMwlgVV13bmHOwNMm?usp=sharing).
