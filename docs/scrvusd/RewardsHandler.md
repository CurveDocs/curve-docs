The `RewardsHandler` contract manages the distribution of crvUSD rewards to `Savings crvUSD (scrvUSD)`. The contract takes snapshots of the ratio of crvUSD deposited into the Vault relative to the total circulating supply of crvUSD to calculate a time-weighted average of this ratio to determine the amount of rewards to request from the `FeeSplitter`.

    The source code for the `RewardsHandler.vy` contract is available on [:material-github: GitHub](https://github.com/curvefi/scrvusd/blob/main/contracts/RewardsHandler.vy). The contract is written in [Vyper](https://vyperlang.org/) version `~=0.4`.

    The contract is deployed on :logos-ethereum: Ethereum at [`0xe8d1e2531761406af1615a6764b0d5ff52736f56`](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe8d1e2531761406af1615a6764b0d5ff52736f56).

# **General Explainer**

The weight allocated to the `RewardsHandler` in the `FeeSplitter` is determined by the time-weighted average of the ratio of crvUSD deposited into the Vault compared to the total circulating supply of crvUSD. The weight allocated to the `RewardsHandler` can be permissionlessly distributed as rewards to the `Savings Vault (scrvUSD)` by anyone calling the [`process_rewards`](#process_rewards) function.

To calculate this time-weighted average, the `RewardsHandler` uses a `TWA module` that takes snapshots of the deposited supply ratio and stores them in a `Snapshot` struct. All structs are stored in a dynamic array called `snapshots`. Each snapshot includes a ratio value and the timestamp at which it was taken.

# **Snapshots**

Snapshots are used to calculate the time-weighted average (TWA) of the ratio between crvUSD deposited into the Vault and the total circulating supply of crvUSD. Each snapshot stores the ratio of crvUSD deposited in the Vault to the circulating supply of crvUSD, along with the timestamp when the snapshot was taken. Taking a snapshot is fully permissionless—anyone can take one by calling the [`take_snapshot`](#take_snapshot) function. The snapshot values are stored in a `Snapshot` struct, and each struct is saved in a dynamic array called `snapshots`.

```vyper
MAX_SNAPSHOTS: constant(uint256) = 10**18  # 31.7 billion years if snapshot every second

snapshots: public(DynArray[Snapshot, MAX_SNAPSHOTS])

struct Snapshot:
    tracked_value: uint256
    timestamp: uint256
```

Snapshots can only be taken once a minimum time interval ([`min_snapshot_dt_seconds`](#min_snapshot_dt_seconds)) has passed since the last one. The TWA is then computed using the trapezoidal rule, iterating over the stored snapshots in reverse chronological order to calculate the weighted average of the tracked value over the specified time window ([`twa_window`](#twa_window)).

*Snapshots are taken by calling the [`take_snapshot`](#take_snapshot) function. When this function is called, the snapshot value is computed and stored as follows:*

1. **Determine the circulating supply of crvUSD.** Directly calling `crvUSD.totalSupply()` is not feasible because some crvUSD is minted to specific contracts and is not part of the circulating supply (e.g., unborrowed crvUSD held by Controllers, crvUSD allocated to PegKeepers, or crvUSD assigned to the [`FlashLender`](../crvUSD/flashlender.md)). Therefore, the [`StablecoinLens`](./StablecoinLens.md) contract is used to obtain the actual circulating supply of crvUSD.
   
2. **Obtain the amount of crvUSD held in the Vault** by calling `Vault.totalAssets()`, which excludes rewards that have not yet been distributed.

3. **Calculate the supply ratio** as follows:
   
    $$\text{SupplyRatio} = \frac{\text{SupplyInVault} \times 10^{18}}{\text{CirculatingSupply}}$$

4. **Store the calculated supply ratio** and the timestamp at which the snapshot was taken in the dynamic array.

# **Weights and TWA**

The `weight` represents the percentage of the total rewards requested from the `FeeSplitter`. This value is denominated in 10000 BPS (100%). E.g. if the weight is 500, then RewardsHandler will request 5% of the total rewards from the `FeeSplitter`.

The `weight` is computed as a time-weighted average (TWA) of the ratio between deposited crvUSD in the Vault and total circulating supply of crvUSD.

Weight calculation is handled using a time-weighted average (TWA) module. While this module can be used to calculate any kind of time-weighted value, the scrvUSD system uses it to compute the time-weighted average of the deposited crvUSD in the Vault compared to the total circulating crvUSD supply.

The value is calculated over a specified time window defined by `twa_window` by iterating backwards over the snapshots stored in the `snapshots` dynamic array.

# **Admin Controls**

The contract uses the [Multi-Role-Based Access Control Module](https://github.com/pcaversaccio/snekmate/blob/main/src/snekmate/auth/access_control.vy) from [Snekmate](https://github.com/pcaversaccio/snekmate) to manage roles and permissions. This module ensures that only specific addresses assigned the `RATE_MANAGER` role can modify key parameters such as the Time-Weighted Average (TWA) window, the minimum time between snapshots, and the distribution time. Roles can only be granted or revoked by the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` defined in the access module.

For a detailed explanation of how to use the access control module, please refer to the source code where its mechanics are explained in detail: [Snekmate access_control.vy](https://github.com/pcaversaccio/snekmate/blob/main/src/snekmate/auth/access_control.vy).
