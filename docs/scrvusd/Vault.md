<h1>VaultV3.vy</h1>

*"Yearn's v3 yVaults are a decentralized suite of yield-generating products built to fit any need. They are designed to be un-opinionated and customizable infrastructure for the world to build on, making yield generation as safe, efficient, and easy as possible for all parties.*

*Version 3 of yVaults iterates on Version 2 by increasing its robustness and developing Yearnâ€™s path towards further decentralization, while keeping the same proven product (yield-bearing tokens). Version 3 has all the same functionality as Version 2, but with many more added benefits and improvements to continue to grow the Yearn ecosystem.*

*V3 also sees the introduction of "Tokenized Strategies". Strategies are now capable of being standalone 4626 vaults themselves. These single-strategy vaults can be used as stand-alone vaults or easily added as a strategy to a Multi-Strategy Vault."*[^1]
