The `StablecoinLens` contract calculates the accurate circulating supply of crvUSD by summing the debt of all `PegKeepers` and the total debt of all `Controllers`. This approach is necessary because simply calling `crvUSD.totalSupply()` returns an inflated number, as it includes idle crvUSD in `PegKeepers`, unborrowed crvUSD in `Controllers`, and crvUSD allocated to the `FlashLender` or other venues.

    The source code for the `StablecoinLens.vy` contract is available on [:material-github: GitHub](https://github.com/curvefi/scrvusd/blob/main/contracts/StablecoinLens.vy). The contract is written using [Vyper](https://vyperlang.org/) version `~=0.4`.

    The contract is deployed on :logos-ethereum: Ethereum at [`0xe24e2db9f6bb40bbe7c1c025bc87104f5401ecd7`](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe24e2db9f6bb40bbe7c1c025bc87104f5401ecd7).

!!!danger "Warning: Usage of `StablecoinLens.vy` contract"
    In theory, the calculation of the true circulating supply of crvUSD could be manipulated using MEV techniques. For example, one could take a flash loan of up to 1 million crvUSD or borrow a significant amount of crvUSD from a Controller, then take a snapshot via `RewardsHandler.take_snapshot()`, and subsequently repay the debt. However, there is a lower bound defined by `minimum_weight` and an upper bound defined by the `FeeSplitter` cap.

    Ultimately, as this calculation is a moving average, successful manipulation would require repeated MEV actions over multiple snapshots to have a substantial impact.

    **Nontheless, the contract should not be used by third parties before consulting with the Curve team.**

### `circulating_supply`
!!! description "`StablecoinLens.circulating_supply() -> uint256`"

    Function to compute the true circulating supply of crvUSD. Calling `totalSupply` directly returns an inflated figure, as it includes idle crvUSD in `PegKeepers`, unborrowed crvUSD in `Controllers`, and crvUSD allocated to the `FlashLender` contract. The true circulating supply is calculated by summing the debt of all `PegKeepers` and the total debt of each `Controller` in the factory.

    *Calculation logic:*

    1. Fetches a predefined crvUSD `Controller` from the `ControllerFactory`, in this case the WETH `Controller`. This is hardcoded and can not be changed.
    2. Fetches the `MonetaryPolicy` from the WETH `Controller` by calling the `monetary_policy()` function.
    3. Iterates over the `PegKeepers` in the `MonetaryPolicy`, summing the debt of all `PegKeepers`. Idle sitting crvUSD in `PegKeepers` are not included in the calculation as they are not circulating.
    4. Iterates over all crvUSD `Controllers` and sums the total debt of each `Controller`.
    5. Returns the combined sum of the debt of all `PegKeepers` and the total debt of all `Controllers`.

    Returns: true circulating supply of crvUSD (`uint256`).
