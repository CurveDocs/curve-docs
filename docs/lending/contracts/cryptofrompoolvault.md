<h1>CryptoFromPoolVault</h1>

This oracle contract takes the **price oracle from a Curve liquidity pool and applies the redemption of the vault token to it**. This is often used when having **ERC-4626 Vault tokens** with `pricePerShare`, `convertToAsset`, or other similar functions which essentially return the price of one vault token compared to the underlying assets. The first oracle contracts were deployed without considering the [aggregated price of crvUSD](../../crvUSD/priceaggregator.md), but experience has shown that it makes sense to include this value in the calculation. The respective differences are documented in the relevant sections.

These kinds of oracle contracts **need to be deployed manually**, as there is currently no `Factory` to do so.

    !!! warning "Oracle Suitability"
        `CryptoFromPoolVaultWAgg.vy` is only suitable for vaults which cannot be affected by [donation attacks](https://mixbytes.io/blog/overview-of-the-inflation-attack).

!!!danger "Oracle Immutability"
    The oracle contracts are fully immutable. Once deployed, they cannot change any parameters, stop the price updates, or alter the pools used to calculate the prices. However, because the contract relies on other pools, it's important to keep in mind that changing parameters in the pool, such as the periodicity of the oracle, can influence these oracle contracts. All relevant data required for the oracle to function is passed into the `__init__` function during the deployment of the contract.

## **Oracle Price**

The oracle price is calculated by taking the `price_oracle` of a Curve pool and then adjusting it by the redemption rate of a vault, using methods such as `convertToAssets`, `pricePerShare` or really any other equvalent function which returns the rate of the vault token and the underlying asset.

!!!example "Example"
    Let's take a look at the [sDOLA/crvUSD lending market](https://curve.finance/lend/ethereum/markets/one-way-market-17/create), which uses the `CryptoFromPoolVaultWAgg.vy` code.

    The [oracle contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x002688C4296A2C4d800F271fe6F01741111B09Be) fetches the `price_oracle` of the [DOLA <> crvUSD stableswap-ng pool](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8272E1A3dBef607C04AA6e5BD3a1A134c8ac063B#readContract#F9) and then adjusts this value by the redemption rate obtained from the [`convertToAssets`](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb45ad160634c528Cc3D2926d9807104FA3157305#readContract#F7) method of the [sDOLA vault](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb45ad160634c528Cc3D2926d9807104FA3157305).

Additionally, the `CryptoFromPoolVault.vy` contract has a **built-in mechanism that considers a certain maximum speed of price change within the vault** when calculating the oracle price. This feature is not included in the `CryptoFromPoolVaultWAgg.vy` oracle contract.

??? quote "Source Code"

    *The formula to calculate the applied redemption rate is the following:*

    $$\min \left( \text{pricePerShare}, \frac{\text{cached_price_per_share} \times (10^{18} + \text{PPS_MAX_SPEED} \times (\text{block.timestamp} - \text{cached_timestamp}))}{10^{18}} \right)$$

    In this example, `pricePerShare` is used, but it can really be any equivalent method that returns the redemption rate of the vault token with respect to its underlying token.

    `cached_price_per_share` and `cached_timestamp` are internal variables that are updated whenever the `price_w` function is called. The first value is set to the current redemption rate within the vault at the block when the function is called, and the second value to the current timestamp (`block.timestamp`).

        ```py
        PPS_MAX_SPEED: constant(uint256) = 10**16 / 60  # Max speed of pricePerShare change

### `price`

    Getter for the price of the collateral asset denominated against the borrowed token and applying the conversion rate form a vault.
