<h1>Building Leverage</h1>

There are multiple ways on how to create automated leverage for lending markets:

- v1: using the [Curve Pools](../../crvUSD/leverage/LeverageZap.md)
- v2: using the [1inch Router](../../crvUSD/leverage/LeverageZap1inch.md)
- v3: using the [Odos Router](../../crvUSD/leverage/LlamaLendOdosLeverageZap.md)

!!!warning "Warning"
    The possibility of creating leverage and the usage of the contract above is dependant on the implementation contract of the `Controller` contract of the market.

    For more information on the leverage feature, please refer to the [Leverage](../crvUSD/leverage/LeverageZapOdos.md) section of the crvUSD documentation.
