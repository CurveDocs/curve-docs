<h1>Curve Finance: Protocol Overview</h1>

Curve is a **decentralized exchange and automated market maker on Ethereum and EVM sidechains/L2s**, designed for the **efficient trading of stablecoins and other volatile assets**. 

The platform is distinguished by its low-risk, supplemental fee income opportunities for liquidity providers, without an opportunity cost. Additionally, Curve has launched its own stablecoin, **crvUSD, featuring a unique liquidation mechanism known as LLAMMA**.

This documentation outlines the technical implementation of the core Curve protocol and related smart contracts. It may be useful for contributors to the Curve codebase, third-party integrators, or technically proficient users of the protocol.

    ---

    Implementation of the Cryptoswap algorithm, as detailed in the [whitepaper](./pdf/stableswap-paper.pdf), into on-chain exchange contracts to facilitate trades between multiple relatively stable assets in comparison to each other (e.g., USDC<>USDT).
