<h1>RewardsHandler.vy</h1>


Contract which handles the rewards distribution to crvUSD stakers. The contract is responsible for taking snapshots of the staked supply ratio of crvUSD and computing the time-weighted average of the TVL ratio to decide on the amount of rewards to ask for (`weight`) from the `FeeSplitter`.

To allow a dynamic weight, the contract requires to support the dynamic weight interface of the FeeSplitter per EIP-165.

```py hl_lines="8"
from ethereum.ercs import IERC165

implements: IERC165

_SUPPORTED_INTERFACES: constant(bytes4[3]) = [
    0x01FFC9A7,  # The ERC-165 identifier for ERC-165.
    0x7965DB0B,  # The ERC-165 identifier for `IAccessControl`.
    0xA1AAB33F,  # The ERC-165 identifier for the dynamic weight interface.
]
```

todo: add guarded functions

# **General Explanation**

The weight in the `FeeSplitter` that is allocated to st-crvUSD is essentially based on the time-weighted average of the staked supply ratio of crvUSD compared to the total supply of crvUSD in circulation.

To calculate the time-weighted average of the staked supply ratio, the `RewardsHandler` takes snapshots of the staked supply ratio and stores them in a `DynArray` of snapshots (stored in the [`TWA` contract](../utils/TWA.md)). Each snapshot contains a supply ratio value which is the staked supply ratio of crvUSD at the time of the snapshot and the timestamp of the snapshot.

```py
struct Snapshot:
    tracked_value: uint256  # In 1e18 precision
    timestamp: uint256
```

Based on these `Snapshots`, a time-weighted average of the staked supply ratio is calculated using the [`TWA`](../utils/TWA.md) module.

The `RewardsHandler` contract is the only contract that can add new snapshots to the `TWA` module. Taking snapshots is fully permissionless and can be done by calling the [`take_snapshot`](#take_snapshot) function.


!!!warning "MEVing Snapshot Taking"
    There's no point in MEVing this snapshot as the rewards distribution rate can always be reduced (if a malicious actor inflates the value of the snapshot) or the minimum amount of rewards can always be increased (if a malicious actor deflates the value of the snapshot).


*Calling the [`take_snapshot`](#take_snapshot) function will compute and store the supply ratio snapshot the following way:*

1. Get the circulating supply of crvUSD in circulation. Simply calling `crvUSD.totalSupply()` is not possible as there are crvUSD minted to several contracts which are not circulating e.g. unborrowed crvUSD from Controllers, allocated crvUSD for PegKeepers or crvUSD allocated to the [`FlashLender`](../crvusd/FlashLender.md).
2. Get the supply of crvUSD in the vault by simply calling `crvUSD.balanceOf(vault)`. This will also take into account rewards that are not yet distributed.
3. Compute the supply ratio as:
   
    $$\text{SupplyRatio} = \frac{\text{SupplyInVault} \times 10^{18}}{\text{CirculatingSupply}}$$

4. The supply ratio is then stored in a `DynArray` of snapshots using the [`_store_snapshot`](#_store_snapshot) function via the [`TWA`](../utils/TWA.md) contract.

# **Snapshots and Weights**


### `take_snapshot`
!!! description "`RewardsHandler.take_snapshot()`"

    Function to take a snapshot of the current staked supply ratio in the vault. This function is fully permissionless and can be called by anyone. Snapshots are used to compute the time-weighted average of the TVL to decide on the amount of rewards to ask for (weight). 
    
    Minimum time between snapshots is defined in the `TWA` module via the `min_snapshot_dt_seconds` variable, which is changable by the `RATE_MANAGER` role using the [`set_min_snapshot_dt`](#set_min_snapshot_dt) function. The maximum number of snapshots is set to `10^18`, which is equivalent to 31.7 billion years if a snapshot is taken every second. (1)
    { .annotate }

    1. Unfortunatly we are doomed in 31.7 billion years.

# **Admin Controls**

The contract uses the [Multi-Role-Based Access Control Module](https://github.com/pcaversaccio/snekmate/blob/main/src/snekmate/auth/access_control.vy) from [Snekmate](https://github.com/pcaversaccio/snekmate) to manage roles and permissions. This module ensures that only specific addresses assigned the `RATE_MANAGER` role can modify key parameters such as the Time-Weighted Average (TWA) window, the minimum time between snapshots, and the distribution time. Roles can only be granted or revoked by the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` defined in the access module.

For a detailed explanation of how to use the access control module, please refer to the source code where its mechanics are explained in detail: [Snekmate access_control.vy](https://github.com/pcaversaccio/snekmate/blob/main/src/snekmate/auth/access_control.vy).
