**The StableSwap Factory utilizes the `create_forwarder_to` function to deploy its contracts from the implementations.**

!!!warning
    **Implementation contracts are upgradable.** They can either be replaced, or additional implementation contracts can be added. Therefore, please always make sure to check the most recent ones.

It utilizes three different implementations:

- **`metapool_implementations`**, containing multiple contracts that are used to deploy metapools.
- **`plain_implementations`**, containing multiple contracts that are used to deploy plain pools.
- **`gauge_implementation`**, containing a contract which is used when deploying liquidity gauges for pools.
