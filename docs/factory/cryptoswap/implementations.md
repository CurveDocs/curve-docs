**The CryptoSwap Factory makes use of the `create_forwarder_to` function to deploy its contracts from the implementations.**

!!!warning
    **Implementation contracts are upgradable.** They can either be replaced, or additional implementation contracts can be added. Therefore, please always make sure to check the most recent ones.

It utilizes three different implementations:

- **`pool_implementation`**, containing a contract that is used to deploy the pools.
- **`token_implementation`**, containing a contract that is used to deploy LP tokens.
- **`gauge_implementation`**, containing a blueprint contract that is used when deploying gauges for pools.


## **Query Implementations**

        ```

    === "Example"
        ```shell
        >>> Factory.pool_implementations()
        '0xa85461AFc2DEEC01bDA23b5cd267d51F765fba10'

    ??? quote "Source code"

        ```vyper
        token_implementation: public(address)
        ```

    === "Example"
        ```shell

        ```


### `gauge_implementation`
!!! description "`Factory.gauge_implementation() -> address: view`"

    Getter for the gauge implementation contract.

    Returns: gauge implementation (`address`).

    ??? quote "Source code"

        ```vyper
        gauge_implementation: public(address)
        ```

    === "Example"
        ```shell
        >>> Factory.gauge_implementation()
