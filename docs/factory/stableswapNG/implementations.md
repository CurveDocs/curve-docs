**The StableSwap-NG Factory makes use of blueprint contracts to deploy its contracts from the implementations.**

!!!warning
    **Implementation contracts are upgradable.** They can either be replaced, or additional implementation contracts can be added. Therefore, please always make sure to check the most recent ones.

It utilizes five different implementations:

- **`pool_implementations`**, containing multiple blueprint contracts that are used to deploy plain pools.
- **`metapool_implementations`**, containing multiple blueprint contracts that are used to deploy metapools.
- **`math_implementation`**, containing math functions used in the AMM.
- **`gauge_implementation`**, containing a blueprint contract that is used when deploying gauges for pools.
- **`views_implementation`**, containing a view methods contract relevant for integrators and users looking to interact with the AMMs.
