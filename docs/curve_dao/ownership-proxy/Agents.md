The Curve DAO has a total of **three [Aragon Agent](https://legacy-docs.aragon.org/aragon/readme) ownership addresses**, which are governed by two independent DAOs:

## **Community DAO** 
The Community DAO (or just “the DAO”) governs the day-to-day operation of the protocol.

Voting is based on a user’s holdings of *“Vote-Escrowed CRV”* (veCRV). veCRV is obtained by locking CRV for up to 4 years, with 1 veCRV equal to 1 CRV locked for 4 years. As the lock time decreases, an account’s veCRV balance decreases linearly as the time remaining until unlock decreases. *veCRV is non-transferrable*.

An account must have a *minimum balance of 2500 veCRV* to make a DAO vote. Each vote lasts for *one week*. Votes cannot be executed after the they successfully passed.

!!!deploy "Contract Source & Deployment"
    **CurveOwnershipAgent** contract is deployed to the Ethereum mainnet at: [0x40907540d8a6C65c637785e8f8B742ae6b0b9968](https://etherscan.io/address/0x40907540d8a6C65c637785e8f8B742ae6b0b9968).  
    **CurveParameterAgent** contract is deployed to the Ethereum mainnet at: [0x4EEb3bA4f221cA16ed4A0cC7254E2E32DF948c5f](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4EEb3bA4f221cA16ed4A0cC7254E2E32DF948c5f).

1. ### **Ownership Admin**
The ownership admin controls most functionality within the protocol. Performing an action via the ownership admin requires a 30% quorum with 51% support.


2. ### **Parameter Admin**
The parameter admin has authority to modify parameters on pools, such as adjusting the amplification co-efficient. Performing an action via the paramater admin requries a 15% quorum with 30% support.  



## **Emergency DAO**
The EmergencyDAO has **limited authority to kill non-factory pools and gauges** during extraordinary circumstances.

!!!deploy "Contract Source & Deployment"
    **EmergencyDAO** contract is deployed to the Ethereum mainnet at: [0x467947EE34aF926cF1DCac093870f613C96B1E0c](https://etherscan.io/address/0x467947EE34aF926cF1DCac093870f613C96B1E0c).

This DAO consists of **nine members**, comprised of a mix of the Curve team and prominent figures within the DeFi community. Each member has one vote. Any member may propose a vote.

All members of the EmergencyDAO may propose new votes. A vote *lasts for 24 hours* and can be *executed immediately once it receives 66% support*.

!!!tip
    To obtain the current members' addresses, query `getOwners` within the [EmergencyDAO contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x467947EE34aF926cF1DCac093870f613C96B1E0c).


### **Killing Pools**

Non-Factory liquidity pools can be killed by calling the `kill_me()` function of the pool. The function can only be called within the first 2 months after deploying the pool.

!!!guard "Guarded Method"
    This function is only callable by the `owner`/`admin` of the pools.
        
Calling `kill_me()` sets the `is_killed` variable of the pool to *True*. 
By doing this, the contract prevents users from performing actions such as `exchange`, `add_liquidity`, `remove_liquidity_imbalance` and `remove_liquidity_one_coin`. 
Users can only remove funds by calling `remove_liquidity`.

In general, a pool can be "unkilled" again by calling the function `unkill_me()`. This reverts the changes made when it was killed."

    ```vyper hl_lines="1 2 3 6 9 12 14"

    kill_deadline: uint256

    def unkill_me():
        assert msg.sender == self.owner  # dev: only owner
        self.is_killed = False    
    ```




### **Killing Gauges**
Gauges can be killed by calling the `set_killed()` function on the corresponding gauge, thereby setting the `is_killed` variable to *True*.  
By doing this, the rate of the gauge is set to 0, effectively stopping all the $CRV emissions.
