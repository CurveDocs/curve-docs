`GaugeProxy` is used for indirect ownership of [liquidity gauges](../liquidity-gauge-and-minting-crv/overview.md).

!!!deploy "Contract Source & Deployment"
    **`GaugeProxy`** contract is deployed on the Ethereum mainnet at: [0x519AFB566c05E00cfB9af73496D00217A630e4D5](https://etherscan.io/address/0x519AFB566c05E00cfB9af73496D00217A630e4D5#code).

# **Deploying Gauges**
Gauges can be directly deployed through the Factory contract. However, deploying a gauge via this contract offers the benefit of automatically adding a gauge manager for the gauge. Without this, an easy [migration](#migrate_gauge_manager) is necessary.

# **Permissionless Rewards** 
LiquidityGauges V4 and later versions introduce the capability for a `distributor` address to *add permissionless rewards* to a gauge. When a gauge is deployed via the Factory, the deployer (`msg.sender`) is automatically set as the *gauge manager*. This address can call the `add_rewards` function within the OwnerProxy to add both `reward tokens` and `distributors`.

To deposit reward tokens, the `distributor` must call the `deposit_reward_token` function within the specific gauge.
