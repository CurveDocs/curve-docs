# Curve DAO: Overview

Curve DAO consists of multiple smart contracts connected by [Aragon](https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS). Interaction with Aragon occurs through a [modified implementation](https://github.com/curvefi/curve-aragon-voting) of the [Aragon Voting App](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/tree/master/apps/voting). Aragonâ€™s standard one token, one vote method is replaced with a weighting system based on locking tokens.

Curve DAO has a token ([CRV](https://etherscan.io/token/0xd533a949740bb3306d119cc777fa900ba034cd52)) which is used for both governance and value accrual.

Source code for the Curve DAO can be found on [Github](https://github.com/curvefi/curve-dao-contracts).
