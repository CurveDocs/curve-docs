`LiquidityGaugeV3` retains a majority of `LiquidityGaugeV2’s` functionality such as tokenized deposits, and flexible onward staking with up to 8 reward tokens with some modifications.

**Outline of modified functionality:**

1. Ability to redirect claimed rewards to an alternative account.  
2. Opt-in claiming of rewards on interactions with the gauge, instead of auto-claiming.
3. Retrieving rewards from the reward contract happens at a minimum of once an hour, for reduced gas costs.
4. Expose the amount of claimed and claimable rewards for users.
5. Removal of `claim_historic_rewards` function.
6. Modify `claimable_reward` to be a slightly less accurate view function.
7. Reward tokens can no longer be removed once set, adding more tokens requires providing the array of reward_tokens with any new tokens appended.
8. `deposit(_value, _to)` and `withdraw(_value, _to)` functions have an additional optional argument `_claim_rewards`, which when set to `True` will claim any pending rewards.

As this gauge maintains a similar API to `LiquidityGaugeV2`, the documentation only covers functions that were added or modified since the previous version.


!!!deploy "Source Code"
    Source code of the LiquidityGaugeV3 can be found on [Github](https://github.com/curvefi/curve-dao-contracts/blob/master/contracts/gauges/LiquidityGaugeV3.vy).
    The following view methods and functions are using the [alUSD/3crv gauge](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9582c4adacb3bce56fea3e590f05c3ca2fb9c477) as an example.  



## Querying Reward Information

### `rewards_receiver`
!!! description "`LiquidityGaugeV3.rewards_receiver() -> address: view`"

    Getter for the reward receiver of address `arg0`.

    Returns: reward receiver (`address`).

    ??? quote "Source code"

        ```vyper hl_lines="1"

        ''
        ```


### `set_rewards_receiver`
!!! description "`LiquidityGaugeV3.set_rewards_receiver(_receiver: address):`"

    Function to set the rewards receiver for any rewards claimed via `claim_rewards`.

    | Input      | Type   | Description |
    | ----------- | -------| ----|
    | `_receiver` |  `address` | Reward Receiver Address |

        ```


### `last_claim`
!!! description "`LiquidityGaugeV3.last_claim() -> uint256:`"

    Getter for the timestamp of the last claim from `reward_contract`.

    Returns: timestamp (`uint256`).

        ```


## Checking and Claiming Rewards

Unlike LiquidityGaugeV2, rewards are not automatically claimed each time a user performs an action on the gauge.


### `claim_rewards`
!!! description "`LiquidityGaugeV3.claim_rewards(_addr: address = msg.sender, _receiver: address = ZERO_ADDRESS):`"

    Function to claim all available reward tokens for `_addr`.

    | Input      | Type   | Description |
    | ----------- | -------| ----|
    | `_addr` |  `address` | Address to claim rewards for |
    | `_receiver` |  `address` | Receiver of the rewards. Defaults to `msg.sender`. |
