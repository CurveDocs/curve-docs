## **Adding New Gauges and Types**

In order for a liquidity gauge to be elegible to receive CRV emission, its address needs to be added to the GaugeController.

### `add_gauge`
!!! description "`GaugeController.add_gauge(addr: address, gauge_type: int128, weight: uint256 = 0):`"

    !!!guard "Guarded Method"
        This function is only callable by the `admin` of the contract.

    !!!warning
        Once a gauge has been added, it cannot be removed. Therefore, new gauges should undergo thorough verification by the community before being added to the GaugeController. It is possible, however, to 'kill' a gauge, which sets its emission rate to zero. As a result, a 'killed' gauge becomes ineligible for any CRV emissions.

    Function to add a new gauge to the GaugeController.

    Emits: `NewGauge`
