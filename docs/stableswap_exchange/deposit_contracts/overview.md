## **Curve StableSwap Exchange: Deposit Contracts**

Curve pools may rely on a different contract, called a _deposit zap_ for the addition and removal of underlying coins. This is particularly useful for lending pools, which may only support the addition/removal of wrapped coins. Furthermore, deposit zaps are also useful for metapools, which do not support the addition/removal of base pool coins.
