The Curve Token V3 is more gas efficient than versions 1 and 2. The implementation for a Curve Token V3 may be viewed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/curvefi/curve-contract/blob/master/contracts/tokens/CurveTokenV3.vy).

!!! note

    Compared to the Curve Token V2 API, there have been the following changes:

    `increaseAllowance` and `decreaseAllowance` methods added to mitigate race conditions.

### `CurveToken.increaseAllowance`

!!! description "`CurveToken.increaseAllowance(_spender: address, _added_value: uint256) → bool`"

    Increase the allowance granted to `_spender` by the `msg.sender`.

    This is alternative to `approve` that can be used as a mitigation for the potential race condition. Returns `True`
    if success.

    | Input      | Type   | Description |
    | ----------- | -------| ----|
    | `_spender` | `address` | Account whose tokens will be burned |
    | `_value` | `uint256` | Amount that will be burned |

    Emits: <mark style="background-color: #FFD580; color: black">Approval</mark>

            """
            @notice Approve the passed address to transfer the specified amount of
                    tokens on behalf of msg.sender
            @dev Beware that changing an allowance via this method brings the risk
                 that someone may use both the old and new allowance by unfortunate
                 transaction ordering. This may be mitigated with the use of
                 {increaseAllowance} and {decreaseAllowance}.

    === "Example"

        ```shell

### `CurveToken.decreaseAllowance`

!!! description "`CurveToken.decreaseAllowance(_spender: address, _subtracted_value: uint256) → bool`"

    Decrease the allowance granted to `_spender` by the `msg.sender`.

    This is alternative to `approve` that can be used as a mitigation for the potential race condition. Returns `True`
    if success.

    | Input      | Type   | Description |
    | ----------- | -------| ----|
    | `_spender` | `address` | Account whose tokens will be burned |
    | `_added_value` | `uint256` | Amount that will be burned |
