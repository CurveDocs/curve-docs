## Overview

The following are methods that may only be called by the pool admin (``owner``).

Additionally, some admin methods require a two-phase transaction process, whereby changes are committed in a first
transaction and after a forced delay applied via a second transaction. The minimum delay after which a committed
action can be applied is given by the constant pool attribute ``admin_actions_delay``, which is set to 3 days.

## Pool Ownership Methods

### `StableSwap.commit_transfer_ownership`

!!! description "StableSwap.commit_transfer_ownership(_owner: address)"

    Initiate an ownership transfer of pool to ``_owner``.

    | Input      | Type   | Description |
    | ----------- | -------| ----|
    | `_owner`       |  `address` | Future owner of the pool contract |

    Emits: <mark style="background-color: #FFD580; color: black">CommitNewAdmin</mark>

    ??? quote "Source code"

        ```vyper
        ADMIN_ACTIONS_DELAY: constant(uint256) = 3 * 86400

        ...

        @external
        def commit_transfer_ownership(_owner: address):
            assert msg.sender == self.owner  # dev: only owner
            assert self.transfer_ownership_deadline == 0  # dev: active transfer

            _deadline: uint256 = block.timestamp + ADMIN_ACTIONS_DELAY
            self.transfer_ownership_deadline = _deadline
            self.future_owner = _owner

            log CommitNewAdmin(_deadline, _owner)
        ```

    === "Example"

        ```shell
        >>> pool.commit_transfer_ownership()
        todo: console output
        ```

    !!! note
        The ownership can not be transferred before ``transfer_ownership_deadline``, which is the timestamp of the
        current block delayed by ``ADMIN_ACTIONS_DELAY``.

### `StableSwap.apply_transfer_ownership`

!!! description "StableSwap.apply_transfer_ownership()"

    Transfers ownership of the pool from current owner to the owner previously set via ``commit_transfer_ownership``.

    Emits: <mark style="background-color: #FFD580; color: black">NewAdmin</mark>

    ??? quote "Source code"

        ```vyper
        @external
        def apply_transfer_ownership():
            assert msg.sender == self.owner  # dev: only owner
            assert block.timestamp >= self.transfer_ownership_deadline  # dev: insufficient time
            assert self.transfer_ownership_deadline != 0  # dev: no active transfer

            self.transfer_ownership_deadline = 0
            _owner: address = self.future_owner
            self.owner = _owner

            log NewAdmin(_owner)
        ```

    === "Example"

        ```shell
        >>> pool.apply_transfer_ownership()
        todo: log output
        ```

    !!! warning

        Pool ownership can only be transferred once.

### `StableSwap.revert_transfer_ownership()`

!!! description "`StableSwap.revert_transfer_ownership()`"

    Reverts any previously committed transfer of ownership. This method resets the
    ``transfer_ownership_deadline`` to ``0``.

    ??? quote "Source code"

        ```vyper
        @external
        def revert_transfer_ownership():
            assert msg.sender == self.owner  # dev: only owner

            self.transfer_ownership_deadline = 0
        ```

    === "Example"

        ```shell
        >>> pool.revert_transfer_ownership()
        todo: log output
        ```

## Amplification Coefficient Admin Controls

The amplification coefficient ``A`` determines a poolâ€™s tolerance for imbalance between the assets within it.
A higher value means that trades will incur slippage sooner as the assets within the pool become imbalanced.

!!! note

    Within the pools, ``A`` is in fact implemented as ``1 / A`` and therefore a higher value implies that the pool will
    be more tolerant to slippage when imbalanced.

The appropriate value for A is dependent upon the type of coin being used within the pool, and is subject to optimisation
and pool-parameter update based on the market history of the trading pair. It is possible to modify the amplification
coefficient for a pool after it has been deployed. However, it requires a vote within the Curve DAO and must reach a
15% quorum.

### `StableSwap.ramp_A`

!!! description "`StableSwap.ramp_A(_future_A: uint256, _future_time: uint256)`"

    Ramp ``A`` up or down by setting a new ``A`` to take effect at a future point in time.

    | Input      | Type   | Description |
    | ----------- | -------| ----|
    | `_future_A`       |  `uint256` | New future value of ``A`` |

## Swap Fees Admin Controls

todo: hyperlink to fee collection and distribution
Curve pools charge fees on token swaps, where the fee may differ between pools. An admin fee is charged on the pool fee.
For an overview of how fees are distributed, please refer to Fee Collection and Distribution.


### `StableSwap.commit_new_fee`
!!! description "`StableSwap.commit_new_fee(_new_fee: uint256, _new_admin_fee: uint256)`"

    The method commits new fee params: these fees do not take immediate effect.

    | Input      | Type   | Description |
    | ----------- | -------| ----|
    | `_new_fee`       |  `uint256` | New pool fee |

    !!! note

        Both the pool ``fee`` and the ``admin_fee`` are capped by the constants ``MAX_FEE`` and ``MAX_ADMIN_FEE``,
        respectively. By default ``MAX_FEE`` is set at 50% and ``MAX_ADMIN_FEE`` at 100% (which is charged on the
        ``MAX_FEE`` amount).

## Kill a Pool

### `StableSwap.kill_me`

!!! description "`StableSwap.kill_me()`"

    Pause a pool by setting the ``is_killed`` boolean flag to ``True``.

    This disables the following pool functionality:

        - add_liquidity
        - exchange
        - remove_liquidity_imbalance
        - remove_liquidity_one_coin

    It is only possible for existing LPs to remove liquidity via ``remove_liquidity`` from a paused pool.
