<h1> Pools: Overview </h1>

**New Features Over the Regular Two-Coin CryptoSwap Implementation:**

- New fee claiming approach
- [**`exchange_received`**](#exchange_received)

## **Fee Claiming**

Admin fees of a Curve pool are usually claimed through an external function, callable by anyone. **Twocrypto-NG does not have any external function to directly claim fees**. Admin fees are claimed through an internal function—when liquidity is removed single-sidedly via the `_remove_liquidity_one_coin` function—and then sent to the fee receiver determined within the Factory contract.

## **`exchange_received`**

This new function **allows the exchange of tokens without actually transfering tokens in**, as the exchange is based on the change of the coins balances within the pool (see code below).    
Users of this method are dex aggregators, arbitrageurs, or other users who **do not wish to grant approvals to the contract**. They can instead send tokens directly to the contract and call **`exchange_received()`**.

### **Example** 

!!!example
    Lets say a user wants to swap **`GOV-TOKEN<>USDC`** through an aggregator. For simplicity we assume, **`GOV-TOKEN<>USDT`** exchange is done via a uniswap pool, **`USDT<>USDC`** via a Curve pool.

``` mermaid
graph LR
    u([USER]) --- p1[(UNISWAP)]
    p1 -->|"3. transfer out/in"| p2[(CURVE)]
    u -..-> |1. approve and transfer| a([AGGREGATOR])
    a ==> |"2. exchange"| p1
    a -.-|"4. exchange_received"| p2
    p2 --> |5. transfer dy out| u
    linkStyle 0 stroke-width:0, fill:none;
```

1. User gives approval the `AGGREGATOR`, which then transfers tokens into the aggregator contract
2. Aggregator exchanges `GOV-TOKEN` for `USDT` using Uniswap  
3. Transfers the `USDT` directly from Uniswap into the Curve pool
4. Perform a swap on the Curve pool (`USDT<>USDC`) via **`exchange_received`**
5. Transfer `USDC` to the user


!!!info 
    This method saves aggregators one redundant ERC-20 transfer and eliminates the need to grant approval to a curve pool. Without this function, the aggregator would have to conduct an additional transaction, transferring USDT from the Uniswap pool to their aggregator contract after the exchange, and then sending it to the Curve pool for another exchange (USDT<>USDC).
    However, with this method in place, the aggregator can transfer the output tokens directly into the next pool and perform an exchange.
