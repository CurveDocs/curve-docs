CryptoSwap is an algorithm designed for automated market-making for volatile (non-pegged) assets. They use liquidity more effectively by concentrating it at current prices. As trades happen, the pool readjusts its internal price to the highest liquidity region without creating losses for the pool. For a detailed overview of the CryptoSwap design, please read the official [CryptoSwap whitepaper](https://docs.curve.fi/references/whitepapers/cryptoswap/).


For an in-depth overview of parameters and how the algorithm utilizes those, see [here](../cryptoswap_exchange/pools/overview.md).
