The `Hooker` contract is a versatile and essential component within the Curve Finance ecosystem, designed to support and manage hooks that interact with the `FeeCollector` contract. This contract enables the execution of predefined actions (hooks) that can be triggered under specific conditions, such as during the fee collection process. It handles the calculation and distribution of compensations, ensuring that hooks are executed correctly and at the appropriate times.

???+ vyper "`Hooker.vy`"
    The source code for the `Hooker.vy` contract can be found on [:material-github: GitHub](https://github.com/curvefi/curve-burners/blob/main/contracts/hooks/Hooker.vy). The contract is written using [Vyper](https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper) version `0.3.10`.

    The `Hooker` contract is deployed on the following chains:

    - :logos-ethereum: Ethereum at [`0x9A9DF35cd8E88565694CA6AD5093c236C7f6f69D`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9A9DF35cd8E88565694CA6AD5093c236C7f6f69D) 
    - :logos-gnosis: Gnosis at [`0xE898893ebAe7b75dc4cAB0fb16e24137309ff178`](https://gnosisscan.io/address/0xE898893ebAe7b75dc4cAB0fb16e24137309ff178)



*The contract has the following key features:*

- **Hook Management**: Hooks can be added to the contract via the `set_hooks` function. These hooks define actions to be executed, including target addresses, method data, and compensation strategies.
- **Compensation Calculation**: The contract includes a comprehensive system for calculating compensation for executing hooks, based on predefined strategies. This ensures that those who execute hooks are fairly rewarded.
- **Execution Control**: The `duty_act` function ensures that mandatory hooks (duty hooks) are executed as part of the fee collection process, while the `act` function allows for general hook execution by anyone.
- **Cooldown Management**: Compensation strategies include cooldown periods to prevent abuse and ensure fair distribution of rewards. The `duty_counter` helps manage these cooldown periods by tracking the epochs in which compensations are made.
- **Security and Access Control**: Certain functions, like `set_hooks` and `one_time_hooks`, are restricted to the contract owner to maintain security and control over the contract's behavior.

Hooks need to be added to the contract via the [`set_hooks`](#set_hooks) function. Once added, these hooks can be executed by anyone using the [`act`](#act) function. Mandatory hooks, marked with the duty flag, are executed during the fee collection process using the [`duty_act`](#duty_act) function.

    If you are running or planning to run fee collection for Curve DAO, there is a Telegram channel and a group for necessary updates. Also, many hooks for automation are coming in the future which will be written about in the group.

## **Compensation Strategy**

Each `hook` includes a `compensation_strategy` that defines how and when the executor of the hook will be compensated. This ensures that there is an incentive to call hooks according to predefined rules.

The `CompensationStrategy` consists of the following values:

```vyper
struct CompensationStrategy:
    amount: uint256  # In case of Dutch auction max amount
    cooldown: CompensationCooldown
    start: uint256
    end: uint256
    dutch: bool

struct CompensationCooldown:
    duty_counter: uint64  # last compensation epoch
    used: uint64
    limit: uint64  # Maximum number of compensations between duty acts (week)
```

- **`amount`**: The maximum amount of compensation available for executing the hook.
- **`CompensationCooldown`**: Contains details about the cooldown period between compensations, consisting of:
    - `duty_counter`: Keeps track of the last epoch in which a compensation was made.
    - `used`: Indicates the number of compensations made within the current cooldown period.
    - `limit`: Represents the maximum number of compensations allowed within the cooldown period.
- **`start`**: Defines the starting time of the compensation period within a week.
- **`end`**: Defines the ending time of the compensation period within a week.
- **`dutch`**: A boolean indicating if the compensation uses a Dutch auction mechanism. If `true`, the compensation amount decreases linearly over time from the `start` to the `end`. This encourages earlier execution of the hook to receive a higher reward.

## **Hooks**

Before hooks can be executed, they need to be added via `set_hooks`. These hooks can then be externally executed by anyone.

## **Executing Hooks**

There are two functions to execute hooks: `duty_act` and `act`.

The `duty_act` method is designed to be called by the `FeeCollector` contract during the `FORWARD` epoch. This function is called when coins are forwarded from the `FeeCollector` using the `forward` function.

The `act` function is a more general function to execute hooks and compensate the caller, callable by anyone.


**Compensation for executing hooks**

The compensation strategy in the Hooker contract determines how and when callers (keepers) are compensated for executing hooks. This strategy includes parameters for managing compensation amounts, cooldowns, and execution limits, ensuring fair and controlled distribution of rewards.


*The compensation strategy is defined within the `CompensationStrategy` struct, which includes several fields:*

```vyper
struct CompensationStrategy:
    amount: uint256  # In case of Dutch auction max amount
    cooldown: CompensationCooldown
    start: uint256
    end: uint256
    dutch: bool
```

- `amount`: The maximum compensation amount. For Dutch auction strategies, this represents the starting maximum amount.
- `cooldown`: A nested struct (CompensationCooldown) that manages the cooldown period and usage limits for compensations.
- `start`: The start time (within a week) for the compensation period.
- `end`: The end time (within a week) for the compensation period.
- `dutch`: A boolean indicating whether the compensation follows a Dutch auction strategy, where the compensation decreases over time.


*The `CompensationCooldown` struct includes fields to manage the number of compensations within a duty cycle and track the duty counter:*

```vyper
struct CompensationCooldown:
    duty_counter: uint64  # last compensation epoch
    used: uint64
    limit: uint64  # Maximum number of compensations between duty acts (week)
```

- `duty_counter`: Tracks the last duty cycle in which compensation was provided.
- `used`: The number of compensations already provided in the current cycle.
- `limit`: The maximum number of compensations allowed within a single duty cycle


*To see the actual value of compensation, see [`calc_compensation`](#calc_compensation).*



### `duty_act`
!!! description "`Hooker.duty_act(_hook_inputs: DynArray[HookInput, MAX_HOOKS_LEN], _receiver: address=msg.sender) -> uint256`"

    Function which executes hooks as part of the fee collection process. It ensures all mandatory hooks, which are marked with the `duty` flag, are executed and handles the distribution of any associated compensation. The function checks that all mandatory duty hooks are included in the `_hook_inputs`.

    Returns: received compensation (`uint256`).

    Emits: `DutyAct`, `HookShot` and `Act`

    *Each `HookInput` struct contains:*

    - `hook_id:` `uint8` - The identifier for the hook to be executed.
    - `value:` `uint256` - The amount of raw ETH to be sent with the hook execution.
    - `data:` `Bytes[8192]` - The data payload for the hook, including the method identifier and parameters.
