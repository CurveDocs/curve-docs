<h1>Liquidity Gauge V6</h1>

## **Depositing and Withdrawing**

Liquidity pool (LP) tokens can be deposited into or withdrawn from a gauge at any time.

In user interfaces and documentation, the terms "staking" and "unstaking" are often used when referring to gauges. However, the terminology used in the actual source code is `deposit` and `withdraw`.

When LP tokens are deposited into a gauge, the smart contract mints an equivalent amount of "gauge tokens" to the depositor. This mechanism ensures that when tokens are withdrawn, the depositor receives the same amount of LP tokens originally deposited. LP tokens are ERC20 tokens and transferable.

!!! example "Example of Depositing and Earning Rewards"
    Alice deposits 100 crvUSD into the crvUSD/USDC liquidity pool and receives 99 LP tokens in return. Observing significant gauge weight and subsequent CRV emissions to this pool, she decides to deposit (stake) her LP tokens into the gauge. Consequently, she begins to earn CRV rewards based on her liquidity share and her boost factor within the pool. Alice can claim rewards or withdraw her LP tokens at any point in time.


### `deposit`

    Function to deposit `_value` of LP tokens into the gauge. When depositing LP tokens into the gauge, the contract mints the equivalent amount of "gauge token" to the user.

## **Claiming Rewards**

Reward tokens can be claimed using the `claim_rewards` function. This function claims all externally added rewards from the gauge in a single transaction.

!!! warning "Which rewards does `claim_rewards` claim?"
    The `claim_rewards` function only claims ["permissionless rewards"](#permissionless-rewards), not CRV emissions directed to the gauge. If there are multiple reward tokens, calling the function will result in a claim of all reward tokens at once.

    CRV emissions directed to the gauge are claimable from the [`Minter.vy`](../minter.md) contract using the [`mint`](../minter.md#mint) function.

The liquidity gauge records checkpoints to determine how much external rewards each user is entitled to claim.

*These checkpoints occur:*

- When a reward token is deposited (this does not record a checkpoint for an individual user but creates a general checkpoint).
- When transferring LP tokens (records a checkpoint for both the sender and the receiver).
- When depositing (staking) LP tokens into the gauge.
- When withdrawing (unstaking) LP tokens from the gauge.
- When rewards (excluding CRV emission rewards, which are claimed via the `Minter.vy` contract) are claimed.

## **Permissionless Rewards**

Newer liquidity gauges (from `LiquidityGaugeV3.vy` and upwards) introduce the possibility to add what are termed "permissionless rewards." However, the term "permissionless" might be misleading as only a `distributor` address, set by the gauge's `manager`, can add these rewards. The `manager` address is set to [`tx.origin`](https://docs.vyperlang.org/en/stable/constants-and-vars.html?highlight=tx.origin#block-and-transaction-properties) at the time of contract deployment.

To add rewards to a gauge, a reward token and a distributor must be set by calling the `set_reward_distributor` function. This action can only be performed by the `manager` or the `admin` of the Factory contract, wich deployed the pool. Each reward token can have only one distributor. The "right to add a reward token" can be transfered. Tokens are added as rewards to the gauge via the `add_reward` method.

!!!warning "NOT BOOSTABLE: Distribution of Externally Added Rewards"
    Externally added rewards are not boostable and are distributed purely based on the user's unboosted share of liquidity in the gauge.

    For example, if Alice holds 10% of the LP tokens staked in the gauge, she will receive 10% of the externally added rewards, assuming there are no changes in her liquidity share or the amount of rewards.



### `reward_data`

## **Boosting Your LP Tokens**

Provided liquidity is boosted by the veCRV balance of the user, allowing for boosts up to 2.5 times. Gauges measure liquidity with respect to the user's boost in the `working_balances` variable. The total liquidity deposited in the gauge is represented by the `working_supply` method.

The [`working_balances`](#working_balances) of a user and the total [`working_supply`](#working_supply) are adjusted via the internal `_update_liquidity_limit` function when the following actions occur:

- **Transferring Tokens**: `working_balances` are adjusted for both the sender and the receiver of the LP tokens.
- **Depositing LP Tokens into the Gauge**: Adjusts the balance to reflect the new total.
- **Withdrawing LP Tokens from the Gauge**: Reduces the balance according to the amount withdrawn.
- **Performing a Manual Checkpoint**: Using the `user_checkpoint` function.
- **When a User is 'Kicked' for Abusing Their Boost**: For more information on what constitutes abuse and the repercussions, see [here](#kick).

Let's examine two different users. Both are providing the same amount of LP tokens (same liquidity), but the first user does not receive a boost because he does not have any veCRV. The second user has a veCRV balance of 500. The total veCRV balance is assumed to be 10,000.


```shell
l = 1000                                    # users LP tokens in gauge
L = 50000                                   # total LP tokens in gauge

voting_balance_user1 = 0                    # veCRV balance user1
voting_balance_user2 = 500                  # veCRV balance user2
voting_total = 10000                        # total veCRV balance
```

---

**NO BOOST**

*Lets calculate the LP position of a user that has a vecrv balance of 0:*

$\text{lim} = 1000 * 0.4 = 400$

$\text{lim} = 400 + 50000 * \frac{0}{10000} * 0.6 = 400$

$\text{lim} = \min(1000, 400)$

*The working supply of this user is 400 LP tokens. The boost is calculated by:*

$\text{boost factor} = \frac{400}{400} = 1$


---


**BOOST**

*Lets calculate the LP position of a user that has a vecrv balance of 500 and therefore receives a boost on his provided liquidity:*

$\text{lim} = 1000 * 0.4 = 400$

$\text{lim} = 400 + 50000 * \frac{500}{10000} * 0.6 = 1900$

$\text{lim} = \min(1000, 1900)$

*The working supply of this user is 1000 LP tokens. The boost is calculated by:*

$\text{boost factor} = \frac{1000}{400} = 2.5$

### `working_balances`
!!! description "`LiquidityGaugeV6.working_balances(arg0: address) -> uint256: view`"

    Getter for the working balances of a user. This represents the effective liquidity of a user, which is used to calculate the CRV rewards they are entitled to. Essentially, it's the boosted balance of a user if they have some veCRV. If a user has no boost at all, their `working_balance` will be 40% of their LP tokens. If the position is fully boosted (2.5x), their `working_balance` will be equal to their LP tokens.

    *For example:*

    - 1 LP token with no boost = `working_balances(user) = 0.4`
    - 1 LP token with 1.5 boost = `working_balances(user) = 1.5`
    - 1 LP token with 2.5 boost = `working_balances(user) = 2.5`

    Returns: working balance (`uint256`).

## **Killing Gauges**

Liquidity gauges have a "killed status" stored in the `is_killed` variable. This status can be set by the `admin` of the Factory, which was used to initially deploy the gauge, using the `set_killed` function. If the status is set to `True`, the gauges' `rate` and `future_rate` will be set to zero, and it will not be eligible to receive any more CRV emissions.

"Killing a gauge" can be undone by simply setting the `is_killed` status back to `false` using the `set_killed` function again.

!!!warning "Effect of Killing Gauges on Rewards"
    "Killing a gauge" affects only CRV emissions; externally added rewards will still be distributed.


### `is_killed`
!!! description "`LiquidityGaugeV6.is_killed() -> bool: view`"

    Getter function to check if the gauge is killed. If `ture`, the inflation rate for the gauge will be set to zero.

    Returns: killed status (`bool`).
