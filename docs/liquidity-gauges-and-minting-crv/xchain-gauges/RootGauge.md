<h1>Root Gauge Implementation</h1>

The `RootGauge` is a simplified liquidity gauge contract on Ethereum used for bridging CRV from Ethereum to a sidechain. This gauge can be, just like any other liquidity gauge, be added to the `GaugeController` and is then eligible to receive voting weight. If that is the case, it can [mint any new emissions and transmit](#checkpointing-emissions) them to the child gauge on another chain using a [bridger contract](#bridger).


???+ vyper "`RootGauge.vy`"
    The source code for the `RootGauge.vy` contract can be found on [:material-github: GitHub](https://github.com/curvefi/curve-xchain-factory/blob/master/contracts/implementations/RootGauge.vy). The contract is written using [Vyper](https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper) version `0.3.10`.

    The contract is deployed on :logos-ethereum: Ethereum at [`0x96720942F9fF22eFd8611F696E5333Fe3671717a`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x96720942F9fF22eFd8611F696E5333Fe3671717a).


Root gauges are deployed from the `RootGaugeFactory` and makes use of Vyper's built-in [create_minimal_proxy_to](https://docs.vyperlang.org/en/stable/built-in-functions.html#create_minimal_proxy_to) function to create a EIP1167-compliant "minimal proxy contract" that duplicates the logic of the contract at target.

# **Initialization**

Because the root gauges are deployed using a proxy pattern, they are automatically initialized directly after deployment.

### `initialize`
!!! description "`RootGauge.initialize(_bridger: Bridger, _chain_id: uint256, _child: address)`"

    Function to initialize the root gauge. Initializes the child gauge address, chain ID, bridger contract, and factory, aswell as sets the `inflation_params` and `last_period`. The function also sets the CRV token approval of the bridger contract to `max_value(uint256)`.

    | Parameter | Type | Description |
    | --------- | ---- | ----------- |
    | `_bridger` | `Bridger` | The bridger contract |
    | `_chain_id` | `uint256` | The chain ID |
    | `_child` | `address` | The child gauge address |

# **Bridger Contracts**

The contract makes use of wrapper contracts around different bridging architectures to bridge CRV emissions to child gauges on other chains. These contracts are granted max approval when initialized in order for being able to transmit CRV tokens. The bridger contract used depends on the chain the child gauge is on. The `RootGaugeFactory` holds different bridger implementations for each chain.

If a bridger contract needs to be updated for whatever reason, this can only be done within the `RootGaugeFactory` using the `set_child` function. After the bridger has been updated, the `update_bridger()` function needs to be called on the specific gauge to update the bridger contract used by the gauge. This sets the CRV token approval of the "old" bridger to 0 and the new bridger to `max_value(uint256)`.

# **Child Gauge**

If a according child gauge is deployed with the same salt as the root gauge, the `child_gauge` variable will hold the address of the child gauge. Additionally, there is a function to set the child gauge in case something went wrong (e.g. between implementation updates or zkSync).

### `child_gauge`
!!! description "`RootGauge.child_gauge() -> address: view`"

    Getter for the corresponding child gauge on another chain.

    Returns: child gauge contract (`address`).

    ??? quote "Source code"

        === "RootGauge.vy"

            ```python
            child_gauge: public(address)
            ```

    === "Example"

        ```py
        >>> RootGauge.child_gauge()
        '0xcde3Cdf332E35653A7595bA555c9fDBA3c78Ec04'
        ```

### `set_child_gauge`
!!! description "`RootGauge.set_child_gauge(_child: address)`"

    !!!guard "Guarded Method"
        This function is only callable by the `owner` of the `RootGaugeFactory`.

    Function to set the child gauge in case something went wrong (e.g. between implementation updates or zkSync).

    | Parameter | Type | Description |
    | --------- | ---- | ------------ |
    | `_child` | `address` | The child gauge address |

    ??? quote "Source code"

        === "RootGauge.vy"

            ```python
            interface Factory:
                def owner() -> address: view

            child_gauge: public(address)

            @external

        >>> RootGauge.child_gauge()
        '0xcde3Cdf332E35653A7595bA555c9fDBA3c78Ec04'

        >>> RootGauge.set_child_gauge('0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890')

        '0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890'
        ```

### `chain_id`
!!! description "`RootGauge.chain_id() -> uint256: view`"

    Getter for the chain ID of the child gauge.

    Returns: chain ID (`uint256`).

    ??? quote "Source code"

        === "RootGauge.vy"

            ```python
            chain_id: public(uint256)
            ```

    === "Example"

        This example returns the chain ID on which the corresponding child gauge is deployed.

        ```py
        >>> RootGauge.chain_id()
        42161
        ```

# **Killing Root Gauges**

Root gauges can be killed by the `owner` of the `RootGaugeFactory` to disable emissions of the specific gauge. Killed gauges will have their inflation rate be set to 0 and therefor restrict any minting of CRV emissions.

### `is_killed`
!!! description "`RootGauge.is_killed() -> bool: view`"

    Getter for the kill status of the gauge.

    Returns: kill status (`bool`).

    ??? quote "Source code"

        === "RootGauge.vy"

            ```python
            is_killed: public(bool)
            ```

    === "Example"

        ```py
        >>> RootGauge.is_killed()
        False
        ```

### `set_killed`
!!! description "`RootGauge.set_killed(_is_killed: bool)`"

    !!!guard "Guarded Method"
        This function is only callable by the `owner` of the `RootGaugeFactory`.

    Function to set the kill status of the gauge. If a gauge is killed, inflation params are modified accordingly to disable emissions. A gauge can be "unkilled" by setting the kill status to `False`, which restores the inflation params to their actual values.

    | Parameter | Type | Description |
    | --------- | ---- | ------------ |
    | `_is_killed` | `bool` | The kill status |

    ??? quote "Source code"

        === "RootGauge.vy"

# **Other Methods**

### `factory`
!!! description "`RootGauge.factory() -> Factory: view`"

    Getter for the `RootGaugeFactory` contract.

    Returns: root gauge factory (`address`).

    ??? quote "Source code"

        === "RootGauge.vy"

            ```python
            factory: public(Factory)
