A Curve pool is essentially a smart contract that implements the StableSwap invariant, housing the logic for exchanging stable tokens. While all Curve pools share this core implementation, they come in various pool flavors.

In its simplest form, a Curve pool is an implementation of the StableSwap invariant involving two or more tokens, often referred to as a 'plain pool.' Alternatively, Curve offers more complex pool variants, including pools with rebasing tokens and metapools. Metapools facilitate the exchange of one or more tokens with those from one or more underlying tokens.


**New features:**   

- price and D oracles
- dynamic fees
- [`exchange_received`](../pools/plainpool.md#exchange_received)
- [`get_dx`](../pools/plainpool.md#get_dx)


## **Supported Assets**

Stableswap-NG pools supports the following asset types:

| Asset Type  | Description            |
| ----------- | ---------------------- |
| `0`         | **Standard ERC20** token with no additional features |
| `1`         | **Oracle** - token with rate oracle (e.g. wstETH) |
| `2`         | **Rebasing** - token with rebase (e.g. stETH) |
| `3`         | **ERC4626** - token with *`convertToAssets`* method (e.g. sDAI) |


*Consequently, supported tokens include:*

- ERC20 support for return True/revert, return True/False, return None  
- ERC20 tokens can have arbitrary decimals (<=18)  
- ERC20 tokens that rebase (either positive or fee on transfer)  
- ERC20 tokens that have a rate oracle (e.g. wstETH, cbETH, sDAI, etc.) Oracle precision *must* be 10^18  
- ERC4626 tokens with arbitrary percision (<=18) of Vault token and underlying asset


### **Rebasing Tokens**

!!!warning "Rebasing Tokens"
    Pools including rebasing tokens work a bit differently compared to others. 
    The internal `**_balance()**` function - which is used to calculate the coin balances within the pool - makes sure that **LP's keep all rebases**.

??? quote "`_balances`"

    ```vyper

    @internal
    def _balances() -> DynArray[uint256, MAX_COINS]:
        """
        @notice Calculates the pool's balances _excluding_ the admin's balances.
        @dev If the pool contains rebasing tokens, this method ensures LPs keep all
                rebases and admin only claims swap fees. This also means that, since
                admin's balances are stored in an array and not inferred from read balances,
                the fees in the rebasing token that the admin collects is immune to
                slashing events.
        """
        result: DynArray[uint256, MAX_COINS] = empty(DynArray[uint256, MAX_COINS])
        balances_i: uint256 = 0

        for i in range(MAX_COINS_128):

            if i == N_COINS_128:
                break

            if 2 in asset_types:
                balances_i = ERC20(coins[i]).balanceOf(self) - self.admin_balances[i]
            else:
                balances_i = self.stored_balances[i] - self.admin_balances[i]

            result.append(balances_i)

        return result
    ```


## **Dynamic Fees**

Stableswap-NG introduces dynamic fees. The use of the **`offpeg_fee_multiplier`** allows the system to dynamically adjust fees based on the pool's state. 

The internal **`_dynamic_fee()`** function calculates the fee **based on the balances and rates** of the tokens being exchanged. If the balances of the tokens being exchanged are highly imbalanced or significantly differ from its peg, the fee is adjusted using the **`offpeg_fee_multiplier`**.


### **Dynamic Fee Formula**

!!!bug
    If the formulas below do not render, please make sure to refresh the site. A solution is being worked on.

*Let's define some terms and variables for clarity:*

- Let $fee$ represent the fee, as retrieved by the method **`StableSwap.fee()`**
- Let $fee_m$ denote the off-peg fee multiplier, sourced from **`StableSwap.offpeg_fee_multiplier()`**
- The terms $rate_{i}$ and $balance{i}$ refer to the specific rate and balance for coin $i$, respectively, and similarly, $rate_j$ and $balance_j$ for coin $j$ 
- $PRECISION_{i}$ and $PRECISION_{j}$ are the precision constants for the respective coins

*Given these, we define:*

$xp_{i} = \frac{{rate_{i} \times balance_{i}}}{{PRECISION_{i}}}$

$xp_{j} = \frac{{rate_{j} \times balance_{j}}}{{PRECISION_{j}}}$

*And we also have:*

$xps2 = (xp_{i} + xp_{j})^2$

**The dynamic fee is calculated by the following formula:**

$$\text{dynamic fee} = \frac{{fee_{m} \times fee}}{\frac{(fee_{m} - 10^{10}) \times 4 \times xp_{i} \times xp_{j}}{xps2}+ 10^{10}}$$

## **Oracles**

The new generation (NG) of stableswap introduces oracles based on AMM State Prices and the invariant D.

- **price oracle** (spot and ema price)
- moving average **D oracle**

Oracles are updated when users perform a swap or when liquidity is added or removed from the pool. Most updates are carried out by the internal **`upkeep_oracles()`** function, which is called in those instances. In some cases, such as when removing liquidity in a balanced ratio, the **`D`** oracle is updated directly within the **`remove_liquidity()`** function, as there is no need to update the price oracles (removing balanced does not have a price impact).

!!!danger "Oracle Manipulation"
    The spot price cannot immediately be used for the calculation of the moving average, as this would allow for single block oracle manipulation. Consequently, **`_calc_moving_average`** uses **`last_prices_packed`**, which retains prices from previous actions.

## **`exchange_received`**

This new function **allows the exchange of tokens without actually transfering tokens in**, as the exchange is based on the change of the coins balances within the pool (see code below).    
Users of this method are dex aggregators, arbitrageurs, or other users who **do not wish to grant approvals to the contract**. They can instead send tokens directly to the contract and call **`exchange_received()`**.

!!!warning
    This function will revert if called on pools that contain rebasing tokens.

### **Example** 

!!!example
    Lets say a user wants to swap **`GOV-TOKEN<>USDC`** through an aggregator. For simplicity we assume, **`GOV-TOKEN<>USDT`** exchange is done via a uniswap pool, **`USDT<>USDC`** via a Curve pool.

``` mermaid
graph LR
    u([USER]) --- p1[(UNISWAP)]
    p1 -->|"3. transfer out/in"| p2[(CURVE)]
    u -..-> |1. approve and transfer| a([AGGREGATOR])
    a ==> |"2. exchange"| p1
    a -.-|"4. exchange_received"| p2
    p2 --> |5. transfer dy out| u
    linkStyle 0 stroke-width:0, fill:none;
```

1. User gives approval the **AGGREGATOR**, which then transfers tokens into the aggregator contract
2. Aggregator exchanges `GOV-TOKEN` for `USDT` using Uniswap  
3. Transfers the `USDT` directly from Uniswap into the Curve pool
4. Perform a swap on the Curve pool (`USDT<>USDC`) via **`exchange_received`**
5. Transfer `USDC` to the user


!!!info 
    This method saves aggregators one redundant ERC-20 transfer and eliminates the need to grant approval to a curve pool. Without this function, the aggregator would have to conduct an additional transaction, transferring USDT from the Uniswap pool to their aggregator contract after the exchange, and then sending it to the Curve pool for another exchange (USDT<>USDC).
    However, with this method in place, the aggregator can transfer the output tokens directly into the next pool and perform an exchange.
