The StableSwapNG-Factory serves as a permissionless pool deployer and registry. For further information regarding the registry, please refer to this [section](../../registry/overview.md).

!!!deploy "Contract Source & Deployment"
    **Stableswap-NG Factory** contract is deployed to the Ethereum mainnet at: [0x6A8cbed756804B16E05E741eDaBd5cB544AE21bf](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6A8cbed756804B16E05E741eDaBd5cB544AE21bf#code).

    A list of all deployments can be found [here](../../references/deployed-contracts.md#stableswap-ng).


## **Fee Receiver**

All deployed pools share the same fee receiver. A new address can be designated by using the [**`set_fee_receiver`**](../factory/admin_controls.md#set_fee_receiver) function.

### `fee_receiver`
!!! description "`Factory.fee_receiver() -> address: view`"

    Getter for the fee receiver of the pools admin fees.

    Returns: fee receiver (`address`).

    ??? quote "Source code"

        ```vyper
        # fee receiver for all pools
        fee_receiver: public(address)
        ```

    === "Example"

        ```shell
        >>> Factory.fee_receiver()
        '0xeCb456EA5365865EbAb8a2661B0c503410e9B347'
        ```


## **Asset Types**

A pool can contain different asset types. All avalaible types can be queried with the following getter method: 

### `asset_types`
!!! description "`Factory.asset_types(arg0: uint8) -> String[20]`"

    Getter for the asset types.

    | Input      | Type   | Description |
    | ----------- | -------| ----|
    | `arg0` |  `uint8` | index value of the asset type |


    ??? quote "Source code"

        ```vyper
        asset_types: public(HashMap[uint8, String[20]])
        ```

    === "Example"

        ```shell
        >>> Factory.asset_types(2)
        'Rebasing'    
        ```


## **Implementations**

Pools and gauges are created through blueprint contracts based on the implementation chosen during deployment.

Additionally, there are utility contracts for Math  (**`math_implementation`**) and Views (**`views_implementation`**).


### `pool_implementations`
!!! description "`Factory.pool_implementations(arg0: uint256) -> address: view`"

    Getter for the pool implementations. There might be multiple pool implementations base on various circumstances.

    | `arg0` |  `uint256` | index value of the implementation |

    ??? quote "Source code"

        ```vyper
        # index -> implementation address
        pool_implementations: public(HashMap[uint256, address])
        ```

    === "Example"

        ```shell
