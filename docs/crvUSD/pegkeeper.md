## **Concept of PegKeepers**  

PegKeepers are contracts that help stabilize the peg of crvUSD. Each Keeper is allocated a specific amount of crvUSD to secure the peg. 
The DAO decides this balance and can be **raised or lowered** by calling **`set_debt_ceiling()`** in the [Factory](../crvUSD/factory.md).


The underlying actions of the PegKeepers can be divided into two actions, which get executed when calling [**`update()`**](#update):

- **crvUSD price > 1**: The PegKeeper mints and deposits crvUSD single-sidedly into the pool to which it is "linked", and receives LP tokens in exchange. This increases the balance of crvUSD in the pool and therefore decreases the price. It is important to note that the LP tokens are not staked in the gauge (if there is one). Thus, the PegKeeper does not receive CRV emissions.

- **crvUSD price < 1**: If PegKeepers hold a balance of the corresponding LP token, they can single-sidedly withdraw crvUSD from the liquidity pool and burn it. This action reduces the supply of crvUSD in the pool and should subsequently increase its price.

!!!note
    PegKeepers do not actually *mint or burn* crvUSD tokens. They have a defined allocated balance of crvUSD tokens they can use for deposits. It is important to note that **PegKeepers cannot do anything else apart from depositing and withdrawing**; therefore, crvUSD token balances of the PegKeepers that are not deposited into a pool should not be counted as circulating supply, although technically they are.

## **Stabilisation Method** 
The most crucial function of the contract is the **`update()`** function. When invoked, the PegKeeper either mints and single-sidedly deposits crvUSD into the StableSwap pool, or it withdraws crvUSD from the pool by redeeming the LP tokens acquired from previous deposits.

* **Deposit and Mint:** This mechanism is triggered when the price of crvUSD exceeds 1. Minting and depositing into the pool will increase the crvUSD supply and decrease its price. The LP tokens that the PegKeeper receives when depositing crvUSD into the pool are not staked in the gauge (if the pool has one), which means the PegKeeper does not receive CRV inflation rewards.

* **Withdraw and Burn:** This mechanism is triggered when the price of crvUSD is less than 1. By withdrawing crvUSD from the pool, the supply of crvUSD decreases, which should increase its price.

PegKeepers have unlimited approval for the liquidity pool, which allows them to deposit and withdraw crvUSD.


### `update`
!!! description "`PegKeeper.update(_beneficiary: address = msg.sender) -> uint256:`"

    Function to either **mint and deposit** or **withdraw and burn** based on the balances within the pools.    

    Emits: `Provide` or `Withdraw`

    | Balances  | Action   | 
    | ----------- | -------| 
    | $balance_{crvUSD} < balance_{pairedCoin}$ |  mint and deposit |
    | $balance_{crvUSD} > balance_{pairedCoin}$ | withdraw and burn |

    A share (`caller_share`) of the generated profit will be awarded to the function's caller. By default, this is set to `msg.sender`, but there is also the possibility to input a `_beneficiary` address to which the rewards will be sent. 

    Returns: caller's profit (`uint256`).

    !!!note
        There is an `ACTION_DELAY` of 15 minutes before calling the function again.

## **Admin and Receiver**
PegKeepers have an **`admin`** and a **`receiver`.** Both of these variables can be altered by calling the respective admin-guarded functions, but such changes must first be approved by a DAO vote. After approval, the newly designated admin or receiver is required to apply these changes within a timeframe of `3 * 86400` seconds, which equates to a window of *three days*. Should there be an attempt to implement these changes after this period, the function to apply the changes will revert.
