<h1>Controller.vy</h1>


The Controller contract acts as a on-chain interface for **creating loans and further managing existing positions**. It holds all user debt information. External liquidations are also done through it.

**Each market has its own Controller**, automatically deployed from a blueprint contract, as soon as a new market is added via the `add_market` function or, for lending markets, via the `create` or `create_from_pool` function within the respective Factory.


---

*Controller contracts are currently used for the following two cases:*


- **Curve Stablecoin - minting crvUSD**

    Minting crvUSD is only possible with whitelisted collateral by the DAO and requires users to provide collateral against which they can mint[^1] crvUSD. Provided collateral is deposited into LLAMMA according to the number of bands chosen. Subsequently, **crvUSD is backed by the assets provided as collateral**.

    <figure markdown="span">
    ![](../assets/images/mint_controller1.svg){ width="500" }
    <figcaption></figcaption>
    </figure>

    [^1]: The system does not actually mint crvUSD, as the tokens are "pre-minted". If a controller has a 100m debt ceiling, 100m crvUSD will be minted to the Controller from which the tokens can be borrowed.

    Repaying the loan is straightforward: Debt is repaid, the health of the loan improves, allowing for the removal of collateral from LLAMMA. When the entire loan is repaid, the user can remove their entire collateral.



- **Curve Lending Markets**

    *[:octicons-arrow-right-24: Curve Lending Overview](../lending/overview.md)*

    In lending markets, not only can crvUSD be borrowed. Every lending market token composition is possible as long as one of the assets, no matter if collateral or borrowable asset, is crvUSD.

    The main difference compared to the minting system above is that there are no tokens minted (neglecting the ERC-4626 vault token here) and therefore **not backed by the provided collateral token**. E.g., if there is a CRV<>crvUSD lending market, with CRV as collateral and crvUSD as borrowable asset, then the borrowed crvUSD are not minted but rather borrowed. **Borrowable assets are provided by lenders**, who deposit the assets into an [ERC-4626 Vault](../lending/contracts/vault.md), where they earn interest for lending out their assets.

    Repaying the loan is straightforward: Debt is repaid, the health of the loan improves, allowing for the removal of collateral from LLAMMA. When the entire loan is repaid, the user can remove their entire collateral.

## **Creating and Repaying Loans**

New loans are created via the **`create_loan`** function. When creating a loan the user needs to specify the **amount of collateral**, **debt** and the **number of bands** to deposit the collateral into.

The maximum amount of borrowable debt is determined by the number of bands, the amount of collateral, and the oracle price.

The loan-to-value (LTV) ratio depends on the number of bands `N` and the parameter `A`. The higher the number of bands, the lower the LTV. More on bands [here](../crvUSD/amm.md#bands).

$$LTV = \text{100%} - \text{loan_discount} - 100 * \frac{N}{2*A}$$


!!!tip "New implementation allows setting `extra_health`"
    With a new implementation introduced a in commits before hash [`b0240d8`](https://github.com/curvefi/curve-stablecoin/tree/b0240d844c9e60fdab78b481a556a187ceee3721), the contract now allows users to set [`extra_health`](#extra_health) using [`set_extra_health`](#set_extra_health). This adds a "health buffer" to the loan when creating it and results in having more health when entering soft liquidation.

!!!colab "Google Colab Notebook"
    A simple notebook showcasing how to create a loan using `create_loan` and then how to read loan information can be found here: [https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1MTtpbdeTDVB3LxzGhFc4vwLsDM_xJWKz?usp=sharing](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1MTtpbdeTDVB3LxzGhFc4vwLsDM_xJWKz?usp=sharing)


### `create_loan`
!!! description "`Controller.create_loan(collateral: uint256, debt: uint256, N: uint256, _for: address = msg.sender)`"

    Function to create a new loan, requiring specification of the amount of `collateral` to be deposited into `N` bands and the amount of `debt` to be borrowed. Less bands mean the collateral is more concentrated into a smaller range, which can lead to higher losses in soft-liquidation. Should there already be an existing loan, the function will revert. Before creating a loan, there is the option to set [`extra_health`](#extra_health) using [`set_extra_health`](#set_extra_health) which leads to a higher health when entering soft liquidation.

    Emits: `UserState`, `Borrow`, `Deposit` and `Transfer`

    | Input        | Type      | Description                           |
    | ------------ | --------- | ------------------------------------- |
    | `collateral` | `uint256` | Amount of collateral token to put up as collateral (at its native precision) |
    | `debt`       | `uint256` | Amount of debt to take on             |
    | `N`          | `uint256` | Number of bands to deposit into; must range between `MIN_TICKS` and `MAX_TICKS` |
    | `_for`       | `address` | Address to create the loan for (requires [`approval`](#approve)); only available in new implementation |

### `create_loan_extended`
!!! description "`Controller.create_loan_extended(collateral: uint256, debt: uint256, N: uint256, callbacker: address, callback_args: DynArray[uint256,5], callback_bytes: Bytes[10**4] = b"", _for: address = msg.sender)`"

    Function to create a new loan using callbacks. This function passes the stablecoin to a callback first, enabling the construction of leverage. Earlier implementations of the contract did not have `callback_bytes` argument. This was added to enable [leveraging/de-leveraging using the 1inch router](./leverage/LeverageZap1inch.md#building-leverage). Before creating a loan, there is the option to set [`extra_health`](#extra_health) using [`set_extra_health`](#set_extra_health) which leads to a higher health when entering soft liquidation.

!!! description "`Controller.approval(arg0: address, arg1: address) -> bool: view`"

    !!!warning
        The mechanism of granting approval, and therefore allowing, e.g., the creation of loans for another user, was introduced in an improved version of LLAMMA. Earlier deployed crvUSD or lending markets might not have this.

    Getter to check the approval status. Approval in this case is either `True` or `False`. It does not approve any specific values. Approval can be set using the [`approve`](#approve) function.

    Returns: `True` or `False`.

        This example shows the amount of collateral needed to support debt using different numbers of bands. The collateral in this example is BTC. For instance, in the first case, to support 10,000 crvUSD as debt using 5 bands, approximately 0.26 BTC is needed as collateral.

        ```shell
        >>> Controller.min_collateral(10**22, 5)
        263399572749066565

        >>> Controller.min_collateral(10**22, 50)

### `calculate_debt_n1`
!!! description "`Controller.calculate_debt_n1(collateral: uint256, debt: uint256, N: uint256, user: address = empty(address)) -> int256`"

    Getter method to calculate the upper band number for the deposited collateral to sit in to support the given debt. This call reverts if the requested debt is too high.

    Returns: upper band n1 (`int256`) to deposit the collateral into.

    | Input        | Type      | Description                                    |
    | ------------ | --------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
    | `collateral` | `uint256` | Amount of collateral (at its native precision) |
    | `debt`       | `uint256` | Amount of requested debt                       |
    | `N`          | `uint256` | Number of bands to deposit into                |
    | `user`   | `empty(address)` | User to calculate the value for; this input is only necessary for nonzero `extra_health` |

        This example shows the upper band into which the collateral is deposited.

        ```shell
        >>> Controller.calculate_debt_n1(10**18, 10**22, 5)
        85

        >>> Controller.calculate_debt_n1(10**18, 10**22, 25)
        76
        ```


### `repay`
!!! description "`Controller.repay(_d_debt: uint256, _for: address = msg.sender, max_active_band: int256 = 2**255-1)`"

    Function to partially or fully repay `_d_debt` amount of debt. If `_d_debt` exceeds the total debt amount of the user, a full repayment will be done.

    Emits: `UserState` and `Repay`

    | Input              | Type      | Description                                                     |
    | ------------------ | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `_d_debt`          | `uint256` | Amount of debt to repay                                         |
    | `_for`             | `address` | Address to repay the debt for; defaults to `msg.sender`         |
    | `max_active_band`  | `int256`  | Highest active band. Used to prevent front-running the repay; defaults to `2**255-1` |
    | `use_eth`          | `bool`    | Use wrapping/unwrapping if collateral is ETH                    |

### `repay_extended`
!!! description "`Controller.repay_extended(callbacker: address, callback_args: DynArray[uint256,5], callback_bytes: Bytes[10**4] = b"",  _for: address = msg.sender)`"

    Extended function to repay a loan but obtain a stablecoin for that from a callback (to deleverage). Earlier implementations of the contract did not have `callback_bytes` argument. This was added to enable [leveraging/de-leveraging using the 1inch router](./leverage/LeverageZap1inch.md#unwinding-leverage).

    Emits: `UserState` and `Repay`

    | Input            | Type                  | Description                                          |
    | ---------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
    | `callbacker`     | `address`             | Address of the callback contract                     |
    | `callback_args`  | `DynArray[uint256,5]` | Extra arguments for the callback (up to 5), such as `min_amount` |
    | `callback_bytes` | `Bytes[10**4]`        | Callback bytes passed to the LeverageZap. Defaults to `b""` |
    | `_for`       | `address` | Address to repay debt for (requires approval); only available in new implementation |

## **Adjusting Existing Loans**

An already existing loan can be managed in different ways:

- `add_collateral`: Adding more collateral.
- `remove_collateral`: Removing collateral.
- `borrow_more`: Borrowing more assets.
- `liquidate`: Partially or fully liquidating a position.



### `add_collateral`
!!! description "`Controller.add_collateral(collateral: uint256, _for: address = msg.sender)`"

    Function to add extra collateral to an existing loan. Reverts when trying to add `0` collateral tokens.

    Emits: `UserState` and `Borrow`

    | Input        | Type      | Description                    |
    | ------------ | --------- | ------------------------------ |
    | `collateral` | `uint256` | Amount of collateral to add    |
    | `_for`       | `address` | Address to add collateral for; defaults to `msg.sender` |

    Function to borrow more assets while adding more collateral. This method uses callbacks to build up leverage. Earlier implementations of the contract did not have `callback_bytes` argument. This was added to enable [leveraging/de-leveraging using the 1inch router](./leverage/LeverageZap1inch.md#building-leverage).

### `health_calculator`
!!! description "`Controller.health_calculator(user: address, d_collateral: int256, d_debt: int256, full: bool, N: uint256 = 0) -> int256`"

    Function to predict the health of `user` after changing collateral by `d_collateral` and/or debt by `d_debt`.

    Returns: health (`int256`).

    | Input          | Type      | Description                                  |
    | -------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------- |
    | `user`         | `address` | Address of the user                          |
    | `d_collateral` | `int256`  | Change in collateral amount                  |
    | `d_debt`       | `int256`  | Change in debt amount                        |
    | `full`         | `bool`    | Weather to take into account the price difference above the highest user's band |
    | `N`            | `uint256` | Number of bands in case loan does not exist yet  |

    === "Example"

        This example shows the calculated health based on changes in collateral and borrowed assets. For instance, in the first example, the predicted health is calculated by adding 1 WBTC as collateral and taking on an additional 10,000 crvUSD in debt.

        ```shell
        >>> Controller.health_calculator(trader, 10**18, 10**22, True, 0)

### `liquidate_extended`
!!! description "`Controller.liquidate_extended(user: address, min_x: uint256, frac: uint256, callbacker: address, callback_args: DynArray[uint256,5], callback_bytes: Bytes[10**4] = b"")`"

    Extended function to perform a bad liquidation (or self-liquidation) of `user` if `health` is not good using callbacks. Earlier implementations of the contract did not have `callback_bytes` argument. This was added to enable [leveraging/de-leveraging using the 1inch router](./leverage/LeverageZap1inch.md).

    Emits: `Repay` and `Liquidate`

    | ---------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `user`           | `address`             | Address to be liquidated                                                   |
    | `min_x`          | `uint256`             | Minimal amount of assets to receive (to avoid liquidators being sandwiched)  |
    | `frac`           | `uint256`             | Fraction to liquidate; 100% = 10**18                                       |
    | `use_eth`        | `bool`                | Use wrapping/unwrapping if collateral is ETH                              |
    | `callbacker`     | `address`             | Address of the callback contract                                          |
    | `callback_args`  | `DynArray[uint256,5]` | Extra arguments for the callback (up to 5), such as `min_amount`          |
    | `callback_bytes` | `Bytes[10**4]`        | Callback bytes passed to the LeverageZap. Defaults to `b""` |

    === "Example"

        This example shows the liquidation range of a user's loan. In this case, the liquidation range would be between 64,018 and 57,897.

        ```shell
        >>> Controller.users_price(trader):
        [6401870706098817273644, 5789737113118292909562]
        ```


### `health`
!!! description "`Controller.health(user: address, full: bool = False) -> int256`"

    Getter for the health of `user`'s loan normalized to 1e18. If health is lower than 0, the loan can be hard-liquidated.

    Returns: health (`int256`).

    | Input  | Type      | Description                                                         |
    | ------ | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `user` | `address` | User address                                                        |
    | `full` | `bool`    | Whether to take into account the price difference above the highest user's band |

# **Fees**

*There are two types of fees:*

1. `Borrowing-based fee`: Borrowers pay **interest** on the debt borrowed.
2. `AMM-based fee`: **Swap fee** for trades within the AMM. There is also the option for an **admin fee**, but at the time of writing, admin fees are set to zero[^2], meaning all swap fees go to the liquidity providers, who are the borrowers themselves.

[^2]: Technically, admin fees within the AMMs are not zero. Currently, the admin fees of the AMMs are set to 1 (= 1/1e18), making them virtually nonexistent. The reason for this is to increase oracle manipulation resistance.

Both fees can be determined by the DAO. To change the borrowing-based fee, a new monetary policy contract needs to be set via [`set_monetary_policy`](#set_monetary_policy).
Changing the AMM fee can be done through [`set_amm_fee`](#set_amm_fee), and admin fees through [`set_admin_fee`](#set_amm_admin_fee).



### `admin_fees`
!!! description "`Controller.admin_fees() -> uint256`"

    Getter for the claimable admin fees. Claimable by calling [`collect_fees`](#collect_fees).

    Returns: admin fees (`uint256`).

# **Loan and Liquidation Discount**

*New values for `loan_discount` and `liquidation_discount` can be assigned by the admin of the Factory, which is the DAO.*

The **loan discount** is the percentage used to discount the collateral for calculating the maximum borrowable amount when creating a loan.

The **liquidation discount** is used to discount the collateral for calculating the recoverable value upon liquidation at the current market price.

### `loan_discount`
!!! description "`Controller.loan_discount() -> uint256: view`"

    Getter for the discount of the maximum loan size compared to `get_x_down()` value. This value defines the LTV.

    Returns: loan discount (`uint256`).

# **Monetary Policy**

Each controller has a monetary policy contract. This contract is responsible for the interest rates within the markets.

While [monetary policies for minting markets](../crvUSD/monetarypolicy.md) depend on several factors such as the price of crvUSD, PegKeeper debt, etc., the monetary policy for lending markets is solely based on a [semi-log monetary policy](../lending/contracts/semilog-mp.md) which determines the rate based on the utilization of the assets.


### `monetary_policy`
!!! description "`Controller.monetary_policy() -> address: view`"

    Getter for the monetary policy contract.

    Returns: monetary policy contract (`address`).

### `set_monetary_policy`
!!! description "`Controller.set_monetary_policy(monetary_policy: address)`"

    !!!guard "Guarded Method"
        This function is only callable by the `admin` of the contract, which is the Factory.

    Function to set the monetary policy contract. Initially, the monetary policy contract is configured when a new market is added via the Factory. However, this function allows the contract address to be changed later. When setting the new address, the function calls `rate_write()` from the monetary policy contract to verify if the ABI is correct.
