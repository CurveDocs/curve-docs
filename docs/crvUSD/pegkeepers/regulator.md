<h1>PegKeeperRegulator</h1>


!!!github "GitHub"
    Source code for `PegKeeperRegulator.vy` available on [GitHub](https://github.com/curvefi/curve-stablecoin/blob/master/contracts/stabilizer/PegKeeperRegulator.vy).

The regulator contract supervises prices and other parameters telling whether the PegKeeper are allowed to provide or withdraw crvUSD.

Technically speaking, allowance is always granted but if certain checks do not pass, the Regulator will allow an amount of 0, which in return can be seen an not allowing anything to deposit or withdraw.


---

## **Providing** 

*The Regulator will grant allowance to the PegKeeper to provide crvUSD to the pool when:*

- Providing is not paused (can be checked with the `is_killed` method).
- The aggregated crvUSD price is higher than 1.0 (`10**18`).
- `get_p` (AMM state price) and `price_oracle` (AMM EMA Price Oracle) are within a certain deviation range (`price_deviation`). This check is done to prevent spam attacks.
- The highest price among the pools that other PegKeepers are stabilizing (defined as `price_oracle` of the pools) is smaller than the difference between the price (`price_oracle`) of the AMM the PegKeeper stabilized and a certain threshold (`worst_price_threshold`).

*If the above requirements are not met, the function will return 0, and the transaction will ultimately revert.*

### `provide_allowed`
!!! description "`PegKeeperRegulator.provide_allowed(_pk: address=msg.sender) -> uint256:`"

    !!!warning
        This function may return a higher amount than the actual crvUSD that can be deposited, as it does not consider the current crvUSD balance of the PegKeeper. The returned value is capped by the maximum crvUSD balance of the PegKeeper in the `_provide` function of the PegKeeper itself.

    Function to check how much crvUSD a PegKeeper is allowed to provide into a liquidity pool. If the PegKeeper is not permitted to provide any, the function will return 0.

    Returns: Amount of crvUSD allowed to provide (`uint256`)

    | Input | Type      | Description                                         |
    |-------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------|
    | `_pk` | `address` | PegKeeper address. Defaults to `msg.sender` as the function is usually called by the PegKeeper itself. |

## **Parameters**

*The Regulator uses several parameters:*

- `worst_price_threshold` is a threshold value for the price of the pegged coin. If the threshold is exceeded, providing crvUSD will not be allowed as the pegged coin is potentially depegged (too far away from other pegged coins' prices).
- `price_deviation` represents an absolute error value and is used to check if prices (`get_p` and `price_oracle`) are within a certain range of each other in order to prevent spam attacks.
- `alpha` and `beta` are used for the calculations of the maximum debt ratio within `_get_max_ratio`.

For more details on the calculations and research behind these parameters, see [here](https://github.com/curvefi/curve-stablecoin-researches/blob/main/peg_keeper/README.md).

## **Adding and Removing PegKeepers**

PegKeepersV2 rely on the Regulator, as it provides the Keeper with information on whether they are allowed to provide or withdraw crvUSD from the pool.

All added PegKeepers are stored within `peg_keepers`.

A PegKeeper can be added by the `admin` through the `add_peg_keepers` function and removed through the `remove_peg_keepers` function.


### `peg_keepers`

    Getter for all PegKeepers which are regulated by this contract.

    Returns: todo

## **Pausing and Unpausing PegKeepers**

"Killing" in this context refers to pausing or unpausing PegKeepers. If the Regulator is "killed," the Regulator contract does not allow the PegKeeper to do one or both, provide or withdraw crvUSD. Both actions, providing and withdrawing, can be killed separately. For example, the regulator can kill the permission to provide any additional crvUSD to pools but can keep the withdrawing "unkilled" so withdrawing is still possible.

Only `admin` and `emergency_admin` are allowed to kill. The former is the Curve DAO, and the latter is the EmergencyDAO.


### `is_killed`
!!! description "`PegKeeperRegulator.is_killed(arg: uint256) -> bool: view`"

    Getter to check if the Regulator allows providing or withdrawing.

    Returns: todo

    | Input      | Type   | Description |

!!! description "`PegKeeperRegulator.set_killed(_is_killed: Killed)`"

    !!!guard "Guarded Methods"
        This function can only be called by the `admin` or `emergency` of the contract.

    Function to pause or unpause PegKeepers.

    There are four options for pausing/unpausing, depending on the value set for the `Killed` enum:

      - `0` -> provide and withdraw allowed
      - `1` -> provide pause, withdraw allowed
      - `2` -> provide allowed, withdraw pause
      - `3` -> provide and withdraw paused

## **Contract Ownership**

The Regulator contract has two types of ownerships, the `admin` and the `emergency_admin`.

While the admin is able to call any guarded function from the contract, like setting new parameters and pausing/unpausing PegKeepers, etc., the `emergency_admin` is only allowed to pause and unpause pools.

Both their ownerships can be transferred using the corresponding `set_admin` or `set_emergency_admin` functions.


### `admin`

### `set_admin`
!!! description "`PegKeeperRegulator.set_admin(_admin: address):`"
