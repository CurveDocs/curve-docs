## **Stabilization Method Enhancement in PegKeeperV2**

The `PegKeeperV2` retains the overarching stabilization approach of its predecessor, `PegKeeperV1`, through the `update` function. This function adapts its operations based on varying conditions to take appropriate measures for maintaining stability.

A significant evolution from `PegKeeperV1` is the integration with the `PegKeeperRegulator` contract. This new contract plays a crucial role in granting allowance to the PegKeepers to deposit into or withdraw from the liquidity pool. Depositing increases the debt of a PegKeeper, while withdrawing reduces it.

For a detailed overview on the additional checks implemented, please see: [Providing](./regulator.md#providing)[^1] and [Withdrawing](./regulator.md#withdrawing).

[^1]: In this context, "providing" is the terminology adopted by the new PegKeeper to describe the act of depositing crvUSD into a liquidity pool, marking a shift from the conventional term "depositing."


### `update`
!!! description "`PegKeeper.update(_beneficiary: address = msg.sender) -> uint256:`"

    Function to provide or withdraw coins from the pool to stabilize it. The `_beneficiary` address is awarded a share of the profits for calling the function. There is a delay of 15 minutes (`ACTION_DELAY`) before the function can be called again. If it is called prior to that, the function will return 0. The maximum amount to provide is to get the pool to a 50/50 balance. Obviously, the PegKeeper is ultimately limited by its own balance of crvUSD. It can't deposit more than it has.  
    If a PegKeeper is ultimately allowed to deposit or withdraw is determined by the `PegKeeperRegulator` and is based on different conditions.

    Returns: amount of profit received by the beneficiary (`uint256`).

    Emits: `Provide`

    | Input          | Type      | Description |
    | -------------- | --------- | ----------- |
    | `_beneficiary` | `address` | Address to receive the caller profit. Defaults to `msg.sender`. |

### `IS_INVERSE`
!!! description "`PegKeeperV2.IS_INVERSE() -> bool: view`"

    Getter to check if crvUSD is inverse. This variable is set when initializing the contract. If crvUSD is coin[0] in the liquidity pool, `IS_INVERSE` will be set to `true`. This variable is not directly relevant in the PegKeeper contract, but it is of great importance in the `PegKeeperRegulator` regarding calculations with oracles. 

    Returns: true or false (`bool`).
