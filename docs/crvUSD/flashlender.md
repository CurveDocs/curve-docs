<h1>FlashLender</h1>

The `FlashLender.vy` contract is an [`ERC-3156`](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3156) contract that allows users to take out a flash loan for `crvUSD`. The flash loan must be repaid within the same transaction; otherwise, the transaction will revert.

!!!github "GitHub"
    The source code for the `FlashLender.vy` contract can be found on [GitHub :material-github:](https://github.com/curvefi/curve-stablecoin/blob/master/contracts/flashloan/FlashLender.vy). Additionally, a `DummyFlashBorrower.vy` contract showcasing a potential usage of a flash loan can also be found on [:material-github: GitHub](https://github.com/curvefi/curve-stablecoin/blob/master/contracts/testing/DummyFlashBorrower.vy).

    The `FlashLender.vy` is deployed at [`0x26dE7861e213A5351F6ED767d00e0839930e9eE1`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x26dE7861e213A5351F6ED767d00e0839930e9eE1) on Ethereum.

The contract does not charge any fees on flash loans. The `fee` and `flashFee` methods are implemented to comply with the `ERC-3156` standard.

### `flashLoan`
!!! description "`FlashLender.flashLoan(receiver: ERC3156FlashBorrower, token: address, amount: uint256, data: Bytes[10**5]) -> bool`"

    Function to take out a flash loan of `amount` of `token` and send them to the `receiver`. The `receiver` address must be a contract that implements the `onFlashLoan(initiator: address, token: address, amount: uint256, fee: uint256, data: Bytes[10**5])` interface. A flash loan must be repaid within the same transaction; otherwise, the transaction will revert. Additionally, the method allows passing custom `data` to the `receiver` contract.

    Returns: `True` (`bool`)

    Emits: `FlashLoan`

    | Input      | Type                   | Description                                   |

    | `amount`   | `uint256`              | Amount of tokens to flash loan                |
    | `data`     | `Bytes[10**5]`         | Custom data to pass to the receiver contract  |

        Calling the function with the `crvUSD` address as input will return the flash-loanable amount. Calling the function with any other token than `crvUSD` will return `0`.

### `flashFee`

    === "Example"

        This method will always return `0` for any amount of flash loaned `crvUSD` because the `fee` is `0`. If the function is called with any token other than `crvUSD`, the function will revert.

### `supportedTokens`
!!! description "`FlashLender.supportedTokens(token: address) -> bool`"

    Getter for the supported token by the `FlashLender`. The only supported token is `crvUSD`. Due to the immutability of the contract, no further supported tokens can be added.
