<h1>AMM.vy</h1>

LLAMMA (Lending Liquidating Automated Market Maker Algorithm) is the **market-making contract that rebalances the collateral of a loan**. It is an algorithm implemented into a smart contract which is **responsible for liquidating and de-liquidating collateral based on market conditions** through arbitrage traders. Each individual market has its own AMM **containing the collateral and borrowable asset**. E.g. the AMM of the [ETH<>crvUSD](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1681195c176239ac5e72d9aebacf5b2492e0c4ee) contains of `ETH` and `crvUSD`.

!!!info "Getting familiar with LLAMMA"
    Before interacting with the `LLAMMA` contract, it is highly advised to read the following section go gain a broader understanding of the system: [LLAMMA Explainer](llamma-explainer.md).


| Glossary             | Description |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ticks`, `bands`     | Price ranges where liquidity is deposited.                                   |
| `x`                  | Coin which is being borrowed, typically a stablecoin.                        |
| `y`                  | Collateral coin.                                                             |
| `A`                  | Amplification, the measure of how concentrated the tick is.                  |
| `rate`               | Interest rate.                                                               |
| `rate_mul`           | Rate multiplier, 1 + integral(rate * dt).                                    |
| `active_band`        | Current band. Other bands are either in one or the other coin, but not both. |
| `min_band`           | Bands below this are definitely empty.                                       |
| `max_band`           | Bands above this are definitely empty.                                       |
| `bands_x[n]`, `bands_y[n]` | Amounts of coin x or y deposited in band n.                            |
| `user_shares[user,n] / total_shares[n]` | Fraction of the n'th band owned by a user.                |
| `p_oracle`           | External oracle price (can be from another AMM).                             |
| `p (as in get_p)`    | Current price of AMM. It depends not only on the balances (x,y) in the band and active_band, but also on p_oracle. |
| `p_current_up`, `p_current_down` | The value of p at constant p_oracle when y=0 or x=0 respectively for the band n. |
| `p_oracle_up`, `p_oracle_down` | Edges of the band when p=p_oracle (steady state), happen when x=0 or y=0 respectively, for band n. |

# **Depositing and Withdrawing Collateral**

Whenever a user performs a collateral-specific action such as creating a new loan or adding more collateral, the collateral asset is deposited or withdrawn from the AMM. These functions are only callable by the admin of the AMM, which is the Controller.

*There are two functions to facilitate the depositing or withdrawing of collateral:*

- Collateral is put into bands by calling `deposit_range()`: This function is called by the `Controller` when one of the following functions is called: `_create_loan`, `_add_collateral_borrow`, `repay`, and `repay_extended`.
- Collateral is removed by calling `withdraw()`: This function is called by the `Controller` when one of the following functions is called: `_liquidate`, `_add_collateral_borrow`, `repay`, and `repay_extended`.


### `deposit_range`
!!! description "`AMM.deposit_range(user: address, amount: uint256, n1: int256, n2: int256)`"

    !!!guard "Guarded Method" 
        This function is only callable by the `admin` of the contract, which is the `Controller`.

    Function to deposit collateral `amount` for `user` in the range between the upper band `n1` and the lower band `n2`. Values for `n1` and `n2` are already determined in the `Controller` contract using the internal `_calculate_debt_n1` method.

    Emits: `Deposit`

    | Input    | Type      | Description                       |
    | -------- | --------- | --------------------------------- |
    | `user`   | `address` | User address.                     |
    | `amount` | `uint256` | Amount of collateral to deposit.  |
    | `n1`     | `int256`  | Lower band in the deposit range.  |
    | `n2`     | `int256`  | Upper band in the deposit range.  |

# **Exchanging Tokens**

The LLAMMA can be used to exchange tokens, just like any other AMM. This is crucial as arbitrage opportunities are created by the LLAMMA, which can be exploited by buying and selling tokens in the AMM. More information: TODO.

*There are two functions to exchange tokens:*

- `exchange`: Allows users to swap a certain amount of input token `i` for output token `j`.
- `exchange_dy`: Allows users to swap input token `i` for a desired amount of output token `j`.

Besides these two exchange functions, there are plenty of "helper functions" which are definitely of good use for searchers and arbitrageurs.

!!! colab "Google Colab Notebook"
    A Google Colab notebook that showcases the use of `exchange` and `exchange_dy` can be found here: [:simple-googlecolab: Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1jT8eMgsFNdYIN2EPBeRtJ-SqaJdzYmIe?usp=sharing).


### `exchange`
!!! description "`AMM.exchange(i: uint256, j: uint256, in_amount: uint256, min_amount: uint256, _for: address = msg.sender) -> uint256[2]:`"

    Function to exchange `in_amount` of token `i` for a minimum amount of `min_amount` of token `j`. If the exchange results in less than `min_amount` of tokens, the function call reverts.

    Returns: amount of coins swapped in and out (`uint256`).

    | Input        | Type      | Description                                         |
    | ------------ | --------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
    | `i`          | `uint256` | Input coin index.                                   |
    | `j`          | `uint256` | Output coin index.                                  |
    | `in_amount`  | `uint256` | Amount of input coin to swap.                       |
    | `min_amount` | `uint256` | Minimum amount of output coin to get.               |
    | `_for`       | `address` | Address to send coins to. Defaults to `msg.sender`. |

# **Bands**

*"Each band works like Uniswap V3, concentrating liquidity between two prices, and being all in the collateral at the lower price and all in crvUSD at the higher price. However since the entire interval of prices are aggressively placed with respect to the market (higher than oracle price when it's moving up and lower when it's moving down), each band gets arbed to hold all of either collateral or stablecoin in the opposite manner than expected when LP-ing with Uniswap V3."*[^2]

[^2]: https://github.com/chanhosuh/curvefi-math/blob/master/LLAMMA.ipynb


Bands in LLAMMA function similarly to UniswapV3, concentrating liquidity between two prices. Essentially, a band is a range of prices into which liquidity is deposited. LLAMMA consists of multiple bands, and when creating a loan, liquidity is equally distributed across the number of bands (`N`) chosen when opening the loan using the [`deposit_range`](amm.md#deposit_range) function. The minimum number of bands is 4, and the maximum is 50.

<figure markdown="span">
  ![](../assets/images/llamma/deposit_range.svg){ width="600" }
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>


Each individual band has an upper ([`p_oracle_up`](#p_oracle_up)) and lower ([`p_oracle_down`](#p_oracle_down)) price bound. These prices are not actual AMM prices, but rather thresholds for the bands. A single band is part of the entire liquidation range. When considering all bands combined, where a user has deposited collateral, we essentially get the entire liquidation range. The entire liquidation range is composed of the "smaller" liquidation ranges of the individual bands. For example, a loan with bands spanning from $1000 to $600 would have a total liquidation range from $1000 to $600.


!!!warning ""
    The following sections assume that arbitrage traders are performing their role and arbitraging the bands. In theory, prices can move through bands without any action if arbitrage traders do not capitalize on the opportunity for free money. We assume that arbitrage traders are taking these opportunities and arbitraging the bands accordingly.
    

*There are three possible scenarios for bands regarding their content of assets. The asset composition of the individual bands is dependant on the collateral price bzw. the "liquidation status" of the loan:*

1. **Band contains both collateral and borrowable token:** This indicates that the band is currently in continuous liquidation mode (either being soft-liquidated because the collateral price is decreasing or de-liquidated because the collateral price is increasing). The band in which the collateral price is currently located is defined as the [`active_band`](amm.md#active_band).

    <figure markdown="span">
    ![](../assets/images/llamma/one_band_final.svg){ width="260" }
    <figcaption></figcaption>
    </figure>

2. **Band contains only the collateral token:** This band has not been soft-liquidated. The collateral price is higher than the upper price of the band and is therefore outside the band. The liquidity in this band is untouched. These are the bands above the [`active_band`](amm.md#active_band). If the active band is 0, all bands greater than 0 consist solely of the collateral token.

    <figure markdown="span">
    ![](../assets/images/llamma/two_bands_eth_final.svg){ width="400" }
    <figcaption></figcaption>
    </figure>

3. **Band contains only the borrowable token:** This band has already been soft-liquidated, meaning the collateral price is below the band, and arbitrage trades have already exchanged all the ETH for crvUSD in the band. These are the bands below the [`active_band`](amm.md#active_band). If the active band is 0, all bands less than 0 consist solely of the borrowable token.

    <figure markdown="span">
    ![](../assets/images/llamma/two_bands_crvusd_final.svg){ width="400" }
    <figcaption></figcaption>
    </figure>



*A full set up bands can look the following:*

<figure markdown="span">
  ![](../assets/images/llamma/three_bands_final.svg){ width="700" }
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>


*In the code, `x` represents the borrowable token, and `y` the collateral token.*


### `A`
!!! description "`AMM.A() -> uint256: view`"

    Getter for A (amplicitation coefficient). The amplication defines the density of the liquidty and band size. The higher `A`, the smaller are the upper and lower prices of the bands an therefor the more leveraged the AMM within each band. The relative band size is $\frac{1}{A}$.

    Returns: amplification coefficient (`uint256`).

    === "Example"

        This user uses 4 bands for their loan. The function returns the collateral composition of all bands. In this case, the 4 bands do not hold any borrow token (the first four returned values), but they hold the collateral token (the last four return values). This signals, that user is not is soft-liquidation, as all his bands are still fully allocated in the collateral tokens. 

        **Fictive example:** E.g. if the first band of the loan would have been liquidated and the second band is currently undergoing liquidation, the returned values could look like the second example below. The first band would be fully in the borrow token (because the band as already been soft-liquidated), the second band would be in both, the borrow and collateral token (because the band is currently being liquidated) and the remaining two bands are still fully composited of the collteral token (because these bands have not been liquidated).

        ```shell
        >>> AMM.get_xy('0x5A684c08261380B91D8976eDB0cabf87744650a5')

### `get_sum_xy`
!!! description "`AMM.get_sum_xy(user: address) -> uint256[2]:`"

    Function to measure the amount of borrow and collateral token a user currently owns inside the AMM. This function does not include the borrowed tokens from the market in any way but rather reflects the current collateral composition summed up across the entire AMM.

    Returns: total borrow token and collateral token (`uint256[2]`).

# **AMM and Oracle Prices**

!!!info "A user's loan is only in soft-liquidation when the price oracle is within the bands of the deposited collateral"
    A position enters soft-liquidation mode only when the price oracle falls within a band where the user has deposited collateral. For example, if a user has collateral deposited between bands 10 and 0, they will not enter soft-liquidation as long as the oracle price stays outside these bands. In this scenario, the only "loss" the user faces is the variable interest rate of the market. Additionally, there is a rather rare possibility that a user's loan was fully soft-liquidated, resulting in all their collateral being converted to the borrowable asset. In such a case, the user would be out of soft-liquidation because the price oracle is below the lowest band.


*The AMM relies on two different prices:*

Soft- and de-liquidation of a loan only occurrs when the collateral price is within a band the user deposited liquidity into. The AMM creates an arbitrage opportunity by utilizing the following two prices:

- **`price_oracle`**: The collateral price fetched from a price oracle contract.
- **`get_p`**: The price of colalteral in the AMM itself.

When `price_oracle` equals `get_p`, the external oracle price and the AMM price are identical, indicating no need for arbitrage. When the external oracle price diverges, the AMM price `get_p` is adjusted to be more sensitive than the regular `price_oracle`, creating arbitrage opportunities. Essentially, arbitrage traders are incentivized to maintain `get_p = price_oracle` within the AMM.

### `get_p` 
!!! description "`AMM.get_p() -> uint256`"

    Function to get the current collateral price within the AMM. `get_p` in always in the active band (`acitve_band`).

    Returns: collateral price within the AMM (`uint256`).

### `get_base_price`
!!! description "`AMM.get_base_price() -> uint256`"

    Function to get the base price of the AMM which corresponds to band 0. The base price grows over time to account for the interest rate: `BASE_PRICE` (= the 'real' base price when the contract was deployed) is multiplied by `_rate_mul` to do so.

    Returns: base price (`uint256`).

### `p_oracle_down`
!!! description "`AMM.p_oracle_down(n: int256) -> uint256`"

    Getter for the lower price bound of an individual band when `get_p` = `price_oracle`. This lower bound is calculated in the same way as `p_oracle_up` but for the next band, essentially taking the upper price of band `n + 1`. It calculates \( n + 1 \) because the lower bound of the current band is defined by the upper bound of the next band.

    Returns: lower price bound (`uint256`).

# **Fees and Interest Rates**

**There are three different types of "fees" within the AMM:**

- **`fee`**: This is charged on token exchanges within the AMM.
- **`admin_fee`**: This determines the percentage of the total fees that are distributed to veCRV holders.
- **`rate`**: This represents the borrow rate a user pays on their loan.

The interest rate (`rate`) is updated whenever the `_save_rate()` method within the `Controller.vy` contract is called. This method is triggered under several circumstances:

- When a loan is created (`_create_loan`).
- When collateral is added or removed, or more debt is borrowed (`_add_collateral_borrow`).
- When debt is repaid (`repay` or `repay_extended`).
- When a hard liquidation is performed (`_liquidate`).
- When fees are collected (`collect_fees`).


### `fee`
!!! description "`AMM.fee() -> uint256: view`"

    Getter for the fee for exchanging tokens in the AMM. This fee is static and can only be changed by the DAO using the [`set_fee`](#set_fee) function. The fee is denominated to a base of $10^{18}$.

    Returns: fee (`uint256`).

### `admin_fee`
!!! description "`AMM.admin_fee() -> uint256: view`"

    Getter for the admin fee of the AMM. This value represents the portion of the `fee` that is awarded to veCRV holders. Currently, the admin fees of the AMMs are set to 1 (1 / 1e18), making them virtually nonexistent. The reason for setting such a small value is to increase resistance to oracle manipulation. Essentially, taking no admin fee ensures that the accumulated fees are distributed among liquidity providers in the AMM (those who provide collateral), which helps offset the losses incurred through soft or de-liquidation and interest rates. Admin fees can be changed by the DAO via the `set_admin_fee` function.

    Returns: admin fee (`uint256`).

## **Admin Ownership**

The `admin` of each AMM is usually set to the corresponding `Controller` contract of the according market. This variable can only be set once and not updated agian as the `set_admin` function checks the follwoing: `assert self.admin == empty(address)`.

The admin can only be set once, which is done when deploying the AMM. Therefore, the `admin` cannot be changed.


### `admin`

    Function to set the admin of the AMM. Maximum approval is given to the Controller in order for it to effectively call functions such as `deposit_range` and `withdraw`. This is achieved through an extra `approve_max` function, because it consumes less byte space compared to calling it directly.
